's cash crunch spurred concern about the prospects for future highly leveraged takeovers <eos> and N minutes after the ual trading halt came news that the ual group could n't get financing for its bid <eos> at this point the dow was down about N points <eos> the market <unk> <eos> arbitragers could n't dump their ual stock but they rid themselves of nearly every rumor stock they had <eos> for example their selling caused trading halts to be declared in usair group which closed down N N to N N delta air lines which fell N N to N N and <unk> industries which sank N to N N <eos> these stocks eventually reopened <eos> but as panic spread speculators began to sell blue-chip stocks such as philip morris and international business machines to offset their losses <eos> when trading was halted

<eos> under an agreement signed by the big board and the chicago mercantile exchange trading was temporarily halted in chicago <eos> after the trading halt in the s&p N pit in chicago waves of selling continued to hit stocks themselves on the big board and specialists continued to <unk> prices down <eos> as a result the link between the futures and stock markets <unk> apart <eos> without the <unk> of stock-index futures the barometer of where traders think the overall stock market is headed many traders were afraid to trust stock prices quoted on the big board <eos> the futures halt was even <unk> by big board floor traders <eos> it <unk> things up said one major specialist <eos> this confusion effectively halted one form of program trading stock index arbitrage that closely links the futures and stock markets and has been blamed by some for the market 's big swings <eos> in a stock-index arbitrage sell program traders buy or sell big baskets of stocks and offset the trade in futures to lock in a price difference <eos> when the airline information came through it <unk> every model we had for the marketplace said a managing director at one of the largest program-trading

at the end of the cooling off period the average was down N points <eos> meanwhile during the the s&p trading halt s&p futures sell orders began <unk> up while stocks in new york kept falling sharply <eos> big board chairman john j. phelan said yesterday the circuit breaker worked well <unk> <eos> i just think it 's <unk> at this point to get into a debate if index arbitrage would have helped or hurt things <eos> under another post-crash system big board president richard <unk> mr. phelan was flying to <unk> as the market was falling was talking on an <unk> hot line to the other exchanges the

again <eos> futures traders say the s&p was <unk> that the dow could fall as much as N points <eos> during this time small investors began ringing their brokers wondering whether another crash had begun <eos> at prudential-bache securities inc. which is trying to cater to small investors some <unk> brokers thought this would be the final <unk> <eos> that 's when george l. ball chairman of the

as the dow average ground to its final N loss friday the s&p pit stayed locked at its <unk> trading limit <eos> jeffrey <unk> of program trader <unk> investment group said N s&p contracts were for sale on the close the equivalent of $ N million in stock <eos> but there were no buyers <eos> while friday 's debacle involved mainly professional traders rather than investors it left the market vulnerable to continued selling this morning traders said <eos> stock-index futures contracts settled at much lower prices than indexes of the stock market itself <eos> at those levels stocks are set up to be <unk> by index arbitragers who lock in profits by buying futures when futures prices fall and simultaneously sell off stocks <eos> but nobody knows at what level the futures and stocks will open today <eos> the <unk> between the stock and futures markets friday will undoubtedly cause renewed debate about whether wall street is properly prepared for another crash situation <eos> the big

<unk> their mutual funds with phone calls over the weekend big fund managers said they have a strong defense against any wave of withdrawals cash <eos> unlike the weekend before black monday the funds were n't <unk> with heavy withdrawal requests <eos> and many fund managers have built up cash levels and say they will be buying stock this week <eos> at fidelity investments the nation 's largest

<eos> people are n't <unk> <eos> the test may come today <eos> friday 's stock market sell-off came too late for many investors to act <eos> some shareholders have held off until today because any

monday <eos> but fund managers say they 're ready <eos> many have raised cash levels which act as a buffer against steep market declines <eos> mario <unk> for instance holds cash positions well above N N in several of his funds <eos> windsor fund 's john <unk> and mutual series ' michael price said they had raised their cash levels to more than N N and N N respectively this year <eos> even peter lynch manager of fidelity 's $ N billion <unk> fund the nation 's largest stock fund built up cash to N N or $ N million <eos> one reason is that after two years of monthly net redemptions the fund posted net inflows of money from investors in august and september <eos> i 've let the money build up mr. lynch said who added that he has had trouble finding stocks he likes <eos> not all funds have raised cash levels of course <eos> as a group stock funds held N N of assets in cash as of august the latest figures available from the investment company institute <eos> that was modestly higher than the N N and N N levels in august and september of N <eos> also persistent redemptions would force some fund managers to dump stocks to raise cash <eos> but a strong level of investor withdrawals is much more unlikely this time around fund managers said <eos> a major reason is that investors already have sharply scaled back their purchases of stock funds since black monday <eos> <unk> sales have rebounded in recent months but monthly net purchases are still running at less than half N levels <eos> there 's not nearly as much <unk> said john <unk> chairman of vanguard group inc. a big valley

today to help investors get through <eos> in an unusual move several funds moved to calm investors with <unk> on their <unk> phone lines <eos> we view friday 's market decline as offering us a buying opportunity as long-term investors a recording at <unk> & co. funds said over the weekend <eos> the <unk> group had a similar recording for investors <eos> several fund managers expect a rough market

N the day after the airline had been planning to <unk> service at houston with four daily flights including three <unk> to phoenix and one <unk> to las vegas <eos> now those routes are n't expected to

<unk> the <unk> effect that a huge manufacturer such as boeing can have on other parts of the economy <eos> it also is sure to help the machinists put added pressure on the company <eos> i just do n't feel that the company can really stand or would want a prolonged <unk> tom baker president of machinists ' district N said in an interview yesterday <eos> i do n't think their customers would like it very much <eos> america west though is a smaller airline and therefore more affected by the delayed delivery of a single plane than many of its competitors would be <eos> i figure that american and united probably have such a hard time counting all the planes in their fleets they might not miss one at all mr. <unk> said <eos> indeed a random check friday did n't seem to indicate that the strike was having much of an effect on other airline operations <eos> southwest airlines has a boeing N set for delivery at the end of this month and expects to have the plane on time <eos> it 's so close to completion boeing 's told us there wo n't be a problem said a southwest spokesman <eos> a spokesman for amr corp. said boeing has assured american airlines it will deliver a N on time later this month <eos> american is preparing to take delivery of another N in early december and N more next year and is n't anticipating any changes in that timetable <eos> in seattle a boeing spokesman explained

four had been delivered and a fifth plane a N was supposed to be <unk> out over the weekend to air china <eos> no date has yet been set to get back to the bargaining table <eos> we want to make sure they know what they want before they come back said doug hammond the federal mediator who has been in contact with both sides since the strike began <eos> the investment community for one has been anticipating a <unk> resolution <eos> though boeing 's stock price was battered along with the rest of the market friday it actually has risen over the last two weeks on the strength of new orders <eos> the market has taken two views that the labor situation will get settled in the short term and that things look very <unk> for boeing in the long term said howard <unk> an analyst at <unk> j. lawrence inc <eos> boeing 's shares fell $ N friday to close at $ N in composite trading on the new york stock exchange <eos> but mr. baker said he thinks the earliest a pact could be struck would be the end of this month <unk> that the company and union may resume negotiations as early as this week <eos> still he said it 's possible that the strike could last considerably longer <eos> i would n't expect an immediate resolution to anything <eos> last week boeing chairman frank <unk> sent striking workers a letter saying that to my knowledge boeing 's offer represents the best overall three-year contract of any major u.s. industrial firm in recent history <eos> but mr. baker called the letter and the company 's offer of a N N wage increase over the life of the pact plus bonuses very weak

the $ N billion u.s. detergent market where growth is slow and <unk> have gained <unk> over <unk> <eos> the company may have chosen to market the product under the <unk> name since it 's already expanded its <unk> tide into N different <unk> including this year 's big hit tide with <unk> <eos> with <unk> however it is n't always easy to persuade consumers that less is more many people tend to

repeatedly to hook consumers on detergent and fabric <unk> <unk> in <unk> but they have n't sold well despite the convenience <eos> but p&g contends the new <unk> is a unique formula that also offers an <unk> that prevents colors from <unk> <eos> and retailers are expected to <unk> the product in part because it will take up less shelf space <eos> when shelf space was cheap bigger was better says <unk> <unk> an analyst at salomon <unk> <eos> but with so many brands <unk> for space that 's no longer the case <eos> if the new <unk> sells well the trend toward smaller packaging is likely to

<eos> with economic tension between the u.s. and japan worsening many japanese had feared last week 's visit from u.s. trade representative carla hills <eos> they expected a new <unk> of demands that japan do something quickly to reduce its trade surplus with the u.s. <eos> instead they got a discussion of the need for the u.s. and japan to work together and of the importance of the long-term view <eos> mrs. hills ' first trip to japan as america 's chief trade negotiator had a completely different tone from last month 's visit by commerce secretary robert a. mosbacher <eos> mr. mosbacher

difference in approach <unk> mr. mosbacher and mrs. hills <eos> many called it simply a contrast in styles <eos> but some saw it as a classic negotiating <unk> <eos> others said the bush

managed trade <eos> asked to compare her visit to mr. mosbacher 's mrs. hills replied i did n't hear every word he spoke but as a general proposition i think we have a very consistent trade strategy in the bush administration <eos> yet more than one american official who sat in with her during three days of talks with japanese officials said her tone often was surprisingly <unk> <eos> i think my

expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability <eos> the gasoline picture may improve this quarter but chemicals are likely to remain weak industry executives and analysts say reducing chances that profits could equal their year-earlier performance <eos> the industry is seeing a softening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in petrochemicals glenn cox president of phillips petroleum co. said in an interview <eos> that change will obviously impact third and fourth

<eos> demand has been much stronger than anticipated and it typically <unk> in the fourth quarter <eos> we could see higher oil prices this year said <unk> <unk> an analyst at painewebber inc <eos> that will translate into sharply higher production profits particularly compared with last year when oil prices steadily fell to below $ N a barrel in the fourth quarter <eos> while oil prices have been better than expected natural gas prices have been worse <eos> in the third quarter they averaged about N N less than they were in N <eos> the main reason remains weather <eos> last summer was

's regional daily newspapers are holding up well but there is little sign that things will improve in the new york market said alan <unk> an analyst with shearson lehman hutton <eos> washington post co. is expected to report improved earnings largely because of increased cable revenue and publishing revenue helped by an improved retail market in the washington area <eos> according to analysts

general motors corp. in a series of moves that angered union officials in the u.s. and canada has signaled that as many as five north american assembly plants may not survive the mid-1990s as the

the company currently using about N N of its north american vehicle capacity has vowed it will run at N N of capacity by N <eos> just a month ago gm announced it would make an aging assembly plant in

competition from new japanese car plants in the u.s. that are pouring out more than one million vehicles a year at costs lower than gm can match <eos> another is that united auto workers union officials have signaled they want tighter <unk> provisions in the new big three national contract that will be negotiated next year <eos> gm officials want to get their strategy to reduce capacity and the work force in place before those talks begin <eos> the problem however is that gm 's moves are coming at a time when <unk> leaders are trying to <unk> <unk> who charge the union is too passive in

this role reversal holds true as well for his three liberal and moderate allies justices <unk> marshall harry <unk> and john stevens <eos> but are these four players three of them in their <unk> ready to assume a different role after N years <unk> of service on the high court <eos> every indication is that the four are prepared to accept this new role and the <unk> that go with it but in different ways <eos> justices <unk> and stevens appear <unk> about it justices marshall and <unk> appear fighting mad <eos> the four justices are no newcomers to dissent often joining forces in the past decade to <unk> the court 's conservative <unk> <eos> but always in years past they have <unk> the trend and have been able to pick up a fifth vote to <unk> out a number of major victories in civil rights and <unk> cases <eos> now however as the court 's new <unk> conservative majority continues to <unk> victories for the liberals are rare <eos> the change is most dramatic for justice <unk> the last

marshall say he was depressed about the court 's direction last spring but is <unk> about his role and determined to speak out against the court 's cutbacks in civil rights <eos> we could sweep it

scholars <eos> harvard law school professor laurence tribe says there is a <unk> flavor to current <unk> <eos> the <unk> in the warren court he says appeared to be writing for the short-term suggesting that the court 's direction might change soon <eos> <unk> and marshall are speaking in their <unk> to a more distant future he says <eos> justice <unk> who will turn N next month also seems

according to those present the late martin <unk> king 's famous i have a dream speech from the N march on washington <eos> justice stevens N is probably the most <unk> of the <unk> about his role in part because he may be the least liberal of the four but also because he enjoys the intellectual challenge of arguing with the majority more than the others <eos> if the role these four <unk> are assuming is a familiar one in modern supreme court history it also <unk> in an important way from recent history court watchers say <eos> the <unk> of the warren court were often defending a legal

the N previous transactions initiated by the resolution trust corp. since it was created in the s&l bailout legislation two months ago <eos> two of the four big thrifts were sold to ncnb corp. charlotte n.c. which has aggressively expanded its markets particularly in texas and florida <eos> a canadian bank bought another thrift in the first rtc transaction with a foreign bank <eos> under these deals the rtc sells just the deposits and the healthy assets <eos> these <unk> transactions leave the bulk of bad assets mostly real estate with the government to be sold later <eos> in these four for instance the rtc is stuck with $ N billion in bad assets <eos> <unk> paid premiums ranging from N N to N N for the deposits and branch systems roughly in line with what analysts were expecting <eos> the buyers will also be locked into deposit rates for just two weeks as has been the case with previous deals <eos> after that the buyers may <unk> the rates paid by the former thrifts <eos> but it 's uncertain whether these institutions will take those steps <eos> ncnb for example has been one of the highest rate <unk> in the texas market and in florida rates are especially sensitive in retirement communities <eos> the rtc had previously targeted five thrifts for quick sales in order to spend cash by certain budgetary deadlines but the delays illustrate the tough <unk> facing the agency <eos> these thrifts are <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> an industry consultant based in <unk> va <eos> for example the delay in selling people 's heritage savings <unk> kan. with $ N

warner inc. 's weekly magazine said time will dramatically <unk> its use of electronic <unk> such as telephones in television subscription drives cut the circulation it guarantees advertisers by N to four million and increase the cost of its annual subscription rate by about $ N to $ N <eos> in a related development the <unk> for the fourth year in a row said it wo n't increase its advertising rates in N a full <unk> page in the magazine costs about $ N <eos> however because the guaranteed circulation base is being lowered ad rates will be effectively N N higher per subscriber according to richard <unk> time associate publisher <eos> time is following the course of some other <unk> magazines that in recent years have challenged the publishing <unk> that maintaining artificially high and expensive <unk> is the way to draw advertisers <eos> in recent years reader 's digest new york times co. 's mccall 's and most recently news corp. 's tv guide have cut their massive circulation rate bases to eliminate marginal circulation and hold down rates for advertisers <eos> deep discounts in <unk> and offers of free <unk> <unk> and watches have become accepted forms of attracting new subscribers in the <unk> world of magazine <unk> <eos> but time as part of the more <unk> time warner wants to <unk> itself away from expensive <unk> <eos> besides time executives think selling a news magazine with a <unk> radio is <unk> <eos> <unk> just give people the wrong image said mr. <unk> <eos> that perception takes the focus off the magazine <eos> time magazine executives predictably <unk> the circulation cut as a show of strength and actually a benefit to advertisers <eos> what we are doing is <unk> out the readers who are only <unk> related to the magazine and do n't really read it said mr. <unk> <eos> we are trying to create quality and involvement <eos> however time executives used the same explanation when in october N the magazine cut its guaranteed circulation from N million to N million <eos> and time 's paid circulation according to audit bureau of <unk> dropped N N to N in the six months ended june N N <eos> still time 's move is being received well once again <eos> it 's <unk> for advertisers to know the reader will be paying more said michael <unk> national media director at bozell inc. ad agency <eos> a few drops in circulation are of no consequence <eos> it 's not a show of weakness they are improving the quality of circulation while <unk> their profits <eos> mr. <unk> said the changes represent a new focus in the magazine industry a magazine 's net revenue per subscriber or the actual revenue from subscribers after discounts and the cost of premiums have been stripped away <eos> the question is how much are we getting from each reader said mr. <unk> <eos> time 's rivals <unk> washington post co. 's newsweek and u.s. news & world report are less <unk> on electronic <unk> and in recent years both have been increasing their circulation rate bases <eos> both magazines are expected to announce their ad rates and circulation levels for N within a month <eos> when the news broke of an attempted coup in panama two weeks ago sen. christopher dodd called the state department for a briefing <eos> they said follow <unk> he told reporters <eos> that shows how far ted turner 's cable news network has come since its birth nine years ago when it was considered the <unk> of television news <eos> it is bigger faster and more profitable than the news divisions of any of the three major broadcast networks <eos> its niche as the network of record during major crises draws elite audiences around the world <eos> but for all its success <unk> has hit a <unk> <eos> although <unk> <unk> when big news breaks it <unk> during periods of calm <eos> <unk> executives worry that the network 's <unk> but <unk> news format may be getting <unk> and wo n't keep viewers coming back as the alternatives <unk> for news and information on cable-tv <eos> just the fact we 're on N hours is no longer <unk> says ed turner <unk> 's executive vice president news gathering and no <unk> to ted turner <eos> you ca n't live on that <eos> so <unk> a unit of atlanta-based turner broadcasting system inc. is trying to <unk> itself as a primary channel or what people in the television industry call a top of mind network <eos> tonight to kick off the effort <unk> will premiere its first prime-time <unk> in years an <unk> show at N p.m eastern time to air <unk> against the network <unk> <eos> the show will be <unk> by bernard shaw and <unk> <unk> a <unk> former texas judge and campus beauty queen who has never held a job in television or journalism <eos> the new show is perhaps the <unk> in a number of steps the network is taking to build audience loyalty by shifting away from its current format toward more <unk> signature programming with <unk> stars <eos> to <unk> itself <unk> is also expanding international coverage and adding a second <unk> program <eos> it is paying higher salaries after years of <unk> to lure and keep experienced staffers <eos> and it is <unk> on an expensive gamble to break major stories with a large <unk> team <eos> the next stage is to get beyond the opinion leaders who use us as a point of reference to become a point of reference at ordinary dinner tables says jon <unk> executive vice president of headline news <unk> 's sister network <eos> but that wo n't be easy <eos> networks like other consumer products develop images in peoples ' minds that are n't easy to change <eos> it also takes money that <unk> has been reluctant to spend to make programs and hire talent that viewers will tune in specially to see <eos> and the cable-tv operators <unk> 's distributors and part owners like things just the way they are <eos> the <unk> bid is aimed at <unk> 's <unk> <unk> and what may happen to it as the cable-tv news market grows more competitive <eos> already <unk> is facing stronger competition from financial news network inc. and general electric co. 's consumer news and business channel both of which are likely to pursue more general news in the future <eos> in addition many cable-tv systems themselves are airing more local and regional news programs produced by local broadcast stations <eos> <unk> wants to change its viewers ' habits <eos> its watchers are on the whole a <unk> group of <unk> <unk> and news <unk> who spend an average of just N minutes a day watching <unk> according to audience research <eos> that 's less than one-third the time that viewers watch the major broadcast networks <eos> the brief attention viewers give <unk> could put it at a disadvantage as ratings data and advertising become more important to cable-tv channels <eos> <unk> 's <unk> habits have been <unk> by its format <eos> its strategy in the past has been to serve as a tv wire service <eos> it focused on building up its news bureaus around the world so as events took place it could go live <unk> and longer than other networks <eos> it filled its daily schedule with <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but the shows <unk> little in content <unk> or look <eos> now the push is on for <unk> shows <eos> our goal is to create more programs with an individual identity says paul <unk> <unk> executive vice president for programming <eos> <unk> <unk> is adding a <unk> show in the morning because surveys show its <unk> hour in the afternoon is among its most <unk> programs in viewers ' minds says mr. <unk> <eos> and it is exploring other original programs similar to its larry king live and <unk> talk shows which executives hope will keep people <unk> in <eos> then there 's the world today the prime-time <unk> featuring mr. shaw and ms. <unk> <eos> until now <unk> has featured its hollywood <unk> show during the key evening period <eos> but N N of the <unk> households that watch news do so between N p.m. and N p.m. the network discovered so <unk> wants in <eos> mr. <unk> says the <unk> team will probably do two live interviews a day with most of the program at least for now appearing similar to <unk> 's other <unk> <eos> some in the industry are skeptical <eos> i find it hard to <unk> of people switching over to <unk> for what at least in the public 's mind is the same news says <unk> frank the former <unk> president of nbc news and <unk> of the <unk> report <eos> the evening news is also slated as <unk> 's stage for its big push into <unk> journalism <eos> in august the network hired <unk> producer <unk> hill the former head of news <unk> at abc <eos> she 's <unk> a staff of about N <unk> reporters who will produce weekly <unk> segments with an eye toward breaking big stories <eos> <unk> executives hope the <unk> created by such <unk> will generate excitement for its <unk> programs in the way N minutes did so well for cbs <eos> that 's such a departure from the past that many in the industry are skeptical <unk> will follow through with its <unk> commitment especially after it sees the cost of producing <unk> pieces <eos> they 've never shown any <unk> to spend money on production says michael <unk> a senior producer with <unk> <unk> who notes that <unk> is <unk> to his job <eos> the network 's salaries have always ranged far below industry standards resulting in a <unk> work force <eos> <unk> recently gave most employees raises of as much as N N but they 're still drastically <unk> compared with the networks <eos> says mr. <unk> <unk> is my wire service they 're on top of everything <eos> but to improve they 've really got to make the investment in people <eos> in any case <unk> operators have reason to fear any <unk> with <unk> 's format <eos> they market cable-tv on the very <unk> opportunities <unk> seeks to discourage <eos> we would obviously be upset if those kinds of services <unk> into more <unk> <unk> programming says robert <unk> senior vice president programming of continental <unk> inc. which holds a N N stake in turner broadcasting <eos> the second u.s. circuit court of appeals opinion in the <unk> <unk> case did not <unk> the position pennzoil co. took in its dispute with texaco contrary to your sept.

renewed their arguments in texas and eight other states where the defense is permitted under state law <eos> the dismissal of the pending suits could go a long way toward clearing court <unk> in texas

friday <eos> after falling for three consecutive months the producer price index for finished goods shot up N N last month the labor department reported friday as energy prices jumped after tumbling through the summer <eos> although the report which was released before the stock market opened did n't trigger the 190.58-point drop in the dow jones industrial average analysts said it did play a role in the market 's decline <eos> analysts immediately viewed the price data the <unk> inflation news in months as evidence that the federal reserve was unlikely to allow interest rates to fall as many investors had hoped <eos> further fueling the belief that pressures in the economy were sufficient to keep the fed from easing credit the commerce department reported friday that retail sales grew N N in september to $ N billion <eos> that rise came on top of a N N gain in august and suggested there is still healthy consumer demand in the economy <eos> i think the friday report combined with the actions of the fed weakened the belief that there was going to be an imminent easing of monetary policy said robert <unk> chief economist at northern trust co. in chicago <eos> but economists were divided over the extent of the inflation threat signaled by the new numbers <eos> the overall N N increase is serious in itself but what is even worse is that excluding food and energy the producer price index still increased by N N said gordon <unk> an economist at the national association of manufacturers <eos> but sung won <unk> chief economist at <unk> corp. in minneapolis blamed rising energy prices and the annual autumn increase in car prices for most of the september jump <eos> i would say this is not bad news this is a <unk> he said <eos> the core rate is not really out of

august <eos> some analysts expect oil prices to remain relatively stable in the months ahead leaving the future pace of inflation uncertain <eos> analysts had expected that the climb in oil prices last month would lead to a substantial rise in the producer price index but the N N climb was higher than most anticipated <eos> i think the <unk> in inflation is going to continue for a few months said john <unk> chief economist at bell <unk> <unk> a washington economic forecasting firm <eos> he predicted that inflation will moderate next year saying that credit conditions are fairly tight world-wide <eos> but <unk> van <unk> president of the national association of <unk> said that last month 's rise is n't as bad an <unk> as the N N figure suggests <eos> if you examine the data carefully the increase is concentrated in energy and motor vehicle prices rather than being a broad-based advance in the prices of consumer and industrial goods he explained <eos> passenger car prices jumped N N in september after climbing N N in august and declining in the late spring and summer <eos> many analysts said the september increase was a one-time event coming as dealers introduced their

september while prices for home electronic equipment fell N N <eos> food prices declined N N after climbing N N in august <eos> meanwhile the retail sales report showed that car sales rose N N in

nonperforming assets rose to slightly more than $ N million from $ N million between june and september <eos> approximately N N of the total <unk> of nonperforming commercial real estate assets <eos>

operations outside its principal markets in new jersey and florida and as a result is taking a charge for discontinued operations <eos> all these actions mr. <unk> said will result in a loss of $ N

federal thrift regulators ordered it to suspend dividend payments on its two classes of preferred stock indicating that regulators ' concerns about the troubled institution have heightened <eos> in a statement miami-based centrust said the regulators cited the thrift 's operating losses and apparent losses in its junk-bond portfolio in ordering the suspension of the dividends <eos> regulators also ordered centrust to stop buying back the preferred stock <eos> david l. paul chairman and chief executive officer criticized the federal office of thrift supervision which issued the <unk> saying it was inappropriate and based on insufficient reasons <eos> he said the thrift will try to get regulators to reverse the decision <eos> the suspension of a preferred stock dividend is a serious step that signals that regulators have deep concerns about an institution 's health <eos> in march regulators labeled centrust a troubled institution largely because of its big junk-bond holdings and its operating losses <eos> in the same month the office of thrift supervision ordered the institution to stop paying common stock dividends until its operations were on track <eos> for the nine months ended june N centrust had a net loss of $ N million compared with year-earlier net income of $ N million <eos> centrust which is florida 's largest thrift holds one of the largest junk-bond portfolios of any thrift in the nation <eos> since april it has <unk> its high-yield bond holdings to about $ N million from $ N billion <eos> mr. paul said only about $ N million of the current holdings are <unk> securities registered with the securities and exchange commission <eos> the remainder he said are commercial loan <unk> or private <unk> that are n't filed with the sec and do n't have a ready market <eos> centrust and regulators have been in a dispute over market <unk> for the junk bonds <eos> the office of thrift supervision has been <unk> centrust to provide current market values for its holdings but centrust has said it ca n't easily obtain such values because of the relative <unk> of the bonds and lack of a ready market <eos> regulators have become increasingly <unk> about centrust 's and other thrifts ' junk-bond holdings in light of the recent federal thrift bailout legislation and the recent deep decline in the junk-bond market <eos> the legislation requires thrifts to <unk> themselves of junk bonds in the new <unk> regulatory climate <eos> in american stock exchange composite trading friday centrust common shares closed at $ N down N cents <eos> in a statement friday mr. paul challenged the regulators ' decision saying the thrift 's operating losses and apparent junk-bond losses have been substantially offset by gains in other activities of the bank <eos> he also said substantial reserves have been set aside for possible losses from the junk bonds <eos> in the third quarter for instance centrust added $ N million to its general reserves <eos> mr. paul said the regulators should instead move ahead with <unk> centrust 's request to sell N of its N branches to great western bank a unit of great western financial corp. based in beverly hills calif <eos> the branch sale is the centerpiece of centrust 's strategy to transform itself into a traditional s&l from a <unk> institution that relied heavily on securities trading for profits according to mr. paul <eos> most analysts and thrift executives had expected a decision on the proposed transaction which was announced in july long before now <eos> many interpret the delay as an indication that regulators are skeptical about the proposal <eos> branches and deposits can be sold at a premium in the event federal regulators take over an institution <eos> centrust however <unk> the branch sale saying it would bring in $ N million and reduce the thrift 's assets to $ N billion from $ N billion <eos> it said the sale would give it positive tangible capital of $ N million or about N N of assets from a negative $ N million as of sept. N thus bringing centrust close to regulatory standards <eos> centrust said the branch sale would also reduce the company 's large amount of good will by about $ N million <eos> critics however say the branch sale will make centrust more dependent than ever on <unk> deposits and junk bonds <eos> mr. paul <unk> that he intends to further <unk> the size of centrust by not renewing more than $ N billion of <unk> certificates of deposit when they come due <eos> the thrift is also working to unload its junk-bond portfolio by continuing to sell off the bonds and it plans to eventually place some

they can get <eos> european programs usually target only their own local audience and often only a small portion of that <eos> <unk> in germany or italy rarely make it even to france or great britain and almost never show up on u.s. screens <eos> attempts to produce <unk> programs have generally resulted in disappointment <eos> one annual <unk> the <unk> <unk> song contest featuring <unk> <unk>

<eos> the trend is pretty well established now that local programs are the most popular with american programs second says brian <unk> a former director of programs for the british broadcasting corp <eos> given a choice everybody will watch a <unk> show <eos> but frequently there is n't much choice <eos> thus europe has begun the recent crusade to produce more worthy shows of its own programs with broader appeal <eos> we 've basically got to start from <unk> to train writers and producers to make shows that other people will want to see concedes <unk> young head of britain 's national film theatre school <eos> while some in the u.s. contend that advertising is the <unk> of television here many believe that its absence is to blame for the european tv industry 's sluggish development <eos> until recently national governments in europe controlled most of the air time and allowed little or no advertising <eos> since production costs were guaranteed it did n't matter that a program could n't be sold abroad or put into <unk> as most american programs are <eos> but not much money was spent on the shows either a situation that encouraged <unk> talk and game shows while discouraging <unk> <unk> <eos> now however commercial channels are coming to most european countries and at the same time satellite and cable technology is spreading rapidly <eos> just last week greece authorized

probably is behind the expected weak performance of <unk> corp. maker of a widely used computer publishing program <eos> he expects <unk> to report earnings of N cents a share on revenues of $ N

hand the battle of the bus is expected to grow increasingly irrelevant <eos> a bus is the data highway within a computer <eos> ibm is backing one type of bus called <unk> while the nine other leading computer makers including <unk> and compaq computer corp. have chosen another method <eos> users do n't care about the bus said daniel benton an analyst at goldman sachs & co <eos> he said apple 's family of <unk> computers for instance uses four different buses and no one seems to mind <eos> the gap between winners and <unk> will grow <eos> in personal computers apple compaq and ibm are expected to tighten their hold on their business <eos> at the same time <unk> firms will continue to lose ground <eos> some lagging competitors even may leave the personal computer business altogether <eos> <unk> technology for instance is considered a candidate to sell its troubled operation <eos> <unk> has done well establishing a distribution business but they have n't delivered products that

<eos> personal-computer makers will continue to eat away at the business of more traditional computer firms <eos> <unk> powerful <unk> computers designed with one or more microprocessors as their brains are expected to increasingly take on functions carried out by more expensive minicomputers and mainframes <eos> the guys that make traditional hardware are really being <unk> by <unk> machines said mr. benton <eos> as a result of this trend longtime <unk> <unk> ibm and digital equipment corp. are scrambling to <unk> with <unk> systems of their own <eos> but they will have to act quickly <eos> mr. benton expects compaq to unveil a family of high-end personal computers later this year that are powerful enough to serve as the hub for communications within large networks of <unk> machines <eos> a <unk> of new computer companies also has targeted this <unk> market <eos> population drain ends for midwestern states <eos> iowa is making a comeback <eos> so are indiana ohio and michigan <eos> the population of all four states is on the <unk> according to new census bureau estimates following declines throughout the early 1980s <eos> the gains to be sure are rather small <eos> iowa for instance saw its population grow by N people or N N between N and N the census bureau says <eos> still even that modest increase is good news for a state that had n't grown at all since N <eos> between N and N north <unk> was the only state in the midwest to lose population a loss of N people <eos> six of the N midwestern states have been growing steadily since N illinois kansas minnesota missouri south <unk> and wisconsin <eos> the northeast has been holding its own in the population race <eos> seven of nine states have grown each year since N including new york which lost N N of its population during the 1970s <eos> and although pennsylvania and massachusetts suffered slight declines earlier in the decade they are growing again <eos> at the same time several states in the south and west have had their own population turnaround <eos> seven states that grew in the early 1980s are now losing population west virginia mississippi louisiana oklahoma <unk> wyoming and alaska <eos> overall though the south and west still <unk> the northeast and midwest and fast-growing states like florida and california ensure that the pattern will continue <eos> but the growth gap between the sun belt and other regions has clearly started narrowing <eos> more elderly maintain their independence <eos> thanks to modern medicine more couples are growing old together <eos> and even after losing a spouse more of the elderly are staying independent <eos> a new census bureau study of the <unk> population shows that N N of people aged N to N were living with a spouse in N up from N N in N <eos> this does n't mean they 're less likely to live alone however <eos> that share has remained at about N N since N <eos> what has changed is that more of the young elderly are living with spouses rather than with other <unk> such as children <eos> in N N N of those aged N to N lived with <unk> other than spouses down from N N in N <eos> as people get even older many become <unk> <eos> but even among those aged N and older the share living with a spouse rose slightly to N N in N from N N in N <eos> like their younger counterparts the older elderly are less likely to live with other <unk> <eos> only N N of those aged N and older lived with <unk> other than spouses in N down from N N in N <eos> the likelihood of living alone beyond the age of N has increased to N N from N N <eos> more people are remaining independent longer presumably because they are better off <unk> and financially <eos> careers count most for the <unk> <eos> many affluent people place personal success and money above family <eos> at least that 's what a survey by ernst & young and <unk> <unk> <unk> indicates <eos> two-thirds of respondents said they strongly felt the need to be successful in their jobs while fewer than half said they strongly felt the need to spend more time with their families <eos> being successful in careers and spending the money they make are top priorities for this group <eos> unlike most studies of the affluent market this survey excluded the <unk> <eos> average household income for the sample was $ N and average net assets were reported as $ N <eos> the goal was to learn about one of today 's fastest-growing income groups the <unk> class <eos> although they represent only N N of the population they control nearly one-third of discretionary income <eos> across the board these consumers value quality buy what they like rather than just what they need and appreciate products that are distinctive <eos> despite their considerable incomes and assets N N of the respondents in the study do n't feel financially secure and <unk> do n't feel that they have made it <eos> <unk> percent do n't even feel they are financially well off <eos> many of the affluent are n't comfortable with themselves either <eos> about N N do n't feel they 're more able than others <eos> while <unk> feel some <unk> about being affluent only N N give $ N or more to charity each year <eos> <unk> percent attend <unk> services regularly at the same time N N feel that in life one sometimes has to compromise one 's principles <eos> odds and ends <eos> the number of women and minorities who hold jobs in top management in the nation 's largest banks has more than doubled since N <eos> the american bankers association says that women make up N N of officials and managers in

this small dallas suburb 's got trouble <eos> trouble with a capital <unk> and that <unk> with <unk> and that stands for pool <eos> more than N years ago prof. harold hill the con man in meredith

free pool tables in its new <unk> <eos> mayor lynn <unk> and two members of the council said they were worried about setting a precedent that would permit pool halls along <unk> 's main street <eos> and the mayor in an <unk> that bears a <unk> <unk> to prof. hill 's warned that alcohol leads to betting which leads to fights <eos> the council 's action is yet another blow to a sport that its fans claim has been <unk> <unk> for years <eos> obviously they 're not in touch with what 's going on says tom <unk> vice president of the national <unk> <unk> association <eos> pool is hot in new york and chicago he insists where upscale <unk> places are adding tables <eos> with today 's tougher drunk driving laws he adds people do n't want to just sit around and drink <eos> besides <unk> behavior seems unlikely at the grand <unk> where rooms average $ N a night and the cheap mixed drinks go for $ N a pop <eos> at the <unk> manager elizabeth <unk> wo n't admit <unk> in jeans <unk> or tennis shoes <eos> but a majority of the <unk> council did n't buy those arguments <eos> introducing pool argued <unk> <unk> <unk> would be dangerous <eos> it would open a can of <unk> <eos> <unk> is no

developer friends and dipped into the town 's <unk> for trips and <unk> <eos> the <unk> embarrassed town officials although they argued that the problems were n't as severe as the media suggested <eos> now comes the pool <unk> <eos> i think there 's some people worried about something pretty ridiculous <unk> john <unk> says <eos> i thought this was all taken care of in the music man <eos> the only thing robert goldberg could <unk> about cbs 's new show island son leisure & arts sept. N was the local color unfortunately neither he nor the producers of the show have done their <unk> <eos> for instance <unk> white is not the ultimate <unk> <unk> <unk> is <eos> richard <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> and rolling up its long <unk> <eos> and the local expression for brother is <unk> not <unk> <eos> and even if a <unk> would wear flowers in her hair while on duty if she were engaged she would know to wear them behind her left not right <unk> <eos> sorry the show does not even have the one <unk> quality of genuine local color <eos> <unk> davis <eos> of all the ethnic <unk> in america which is the most troublesome right now <eos> a good bet would be the tension between blacks and <unk> in new york city <eos> or so it must seem to <unk> mason the veteran jewish <unk> appearing in a new abc <unk> airing on tuesday nights N p.m. edt <eos> not only is mr. mason the star of chicken soup he 's also the <unk> of a <unk> tradition dating back to duck soup and he 's currently a man in hot water <eos> here in neutral language is the <unk> of mr. mason 's remarks quoted first in the village voice while he was a paid spokesman for the rudolph giuliani mayoral campaign and then in newsweek after he and the campaign <unk> company <eos> mr. mason said that many jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks so they support black candidates <unk> <eos> he said that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination so they too support black candidates <unk> <eos> he said that <unk> have contributed more to black causes over the years than vice <unk> <eos> of course mr. mason did not use neutral language <eos> as a <unk> of ethnic humor from the old days on the <unk> belt live television and the <unk> circuit mr. mason <unk> reached for the <unk> <eos> he said <unk> were sick with <unk> and he called david dinkins mr. giuliani 's black opponent a fancy <unk> with a <unk> <eos> if mr. mason had used less <unk> language to <unk> his <unk> analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow new <unk> would the water be quite so hot <eos> it probably would because few or none of the people upset by mr. mason 's remarks have bothered to <unk> between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used <unk> language <eos> in addition some of mr. mason 's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of <unk> <eos> for example the new york state counsel for the <unk> said that mr. mason is like a <unk> <eos> people are fast leaving the place where he is stuck <eos> these critics fail to <unk> between the type of ethnic humor that aims at <unk> another group such as polish jokes and the type that is <unk> aiming <unk> as well as <unk> <eos> the latter typically is the humor of the <unk> and it was <unk> by both blacks and <unk> on the <unk> and <unk> stage as a means of <unk> their white and <unk> audiences along with themselves <eos> in the hands of a <unk> like <unk> bruce this <unk> <unk> could cut both the <unk> and the audience to <unk> <eos> but <unk> by a pro like <unk> mason it is a <unk> form of <unk> <eos> why <unk> <eos> because despite all the media <unk> about comedy and politics not <unk> they are similar in one respect both can serve as <unk> for easing <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of groups in conflict <eos> that 's why it 's dangerous to have <unk> thought police on college <unk> and elsewhere <unk> all critical mention of group differences <eos> as elizabeth <unk> wrote in the new york times just before the mason <unk> perhaps <unk> would not <unk> over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed to <unk> <eos> the question is if group conflicts still exist as <unk> they do and if mr. mason 's type of ethnic humor is <unk> then what other means do we have for letting off steam <eos> do n't say the tv <unk> because that happens to be a <unk> that in its desperate need to attract everybody and <unk> nobody resembles politics more than it does comedy <eos> it is true that the best <unk> do allow group differences to <unk> <unk> vs. blue-collar <unk> in <unk> children vs. adults in the cosby show <eos> but these are not the differences that make <unk> <eos> in chicken soup mr. mason plays <unk> a jewish <unk> <unk> <unk> lynn <unk> an irish widow and mother of three against the wishes of his mother <unk> <unk> and her brother michael <unk> <unk> <eos> it 's worth noting that both <unk> <unk> are <unk> <eos> at least they both speak with strong <unk> as do <unk> and <unk> <eos> it could n't be more obvious that chicken soup is being made from an old <unk> <eos> and a safe one imagine if the <unk> in question were between an orthodox <unk> and a member of the nation of <unk> <eos> back in the 1920s the play and movie versions of <unk> 's irish rose made the theme of <unk> between the <unk> <unk> of jewish and irish <unk> so popular that its author anne <unk> lost a <unk> suit on the grounds that the plot has entered the public <unk> <eos> and it has remained there as <unk> by its <unk> in a N cbs <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> whose sole <unk> was that it led to the <unk> marriage of meredith <unk> and david <unk> <eos> clearly the question with chicken soup is not whether the pot will <unk> over but whether it will <unk> at all <eos> so far the <unk> have been few and far between <eos> part of the problem is the tendency of all <unk> ever since the <unk> days of norman <unk> to <unk> about social issues <eos> to some extent this tendency emerges whenever the show tries to <unk> us about ethnic <unk> by <unk> them <eos> for instance michael <unk> <unk> not because he 's a <unk> jewish businessman but because he <unk> his <unk> job as a salesman in order to become a social worker <eos> even more <unk> is the <unk> between <unk> <unk> and mr. mason 's comic <unk> <eos> the best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end and occasionally in the middle when mr. mason <unk> into his <unk> mode and starts <unk> out that old-fashioned jewish <unk> to other people as well as to himself <eos> but too often these <unk> lack spark because this <unk> like all <unk> is <unk> about <unk> mr. mason 's stock in trade ethnic differences <eos> i 'm not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the <unk> dispute over the <unk> <unk> at <unk> <eos> that issue like racial <unk> in new york city will have to cool down not heat up before it can <unk> <eos> but i am suggesting that they stop requiring mr. mason to <unk> his classic <unk> with some line about <unk> for other people that would sound <unk> on the <unk> of miss america <eos> at your age <unk> you ought to know that you ca n't make soup without turning up the <unk> <eos> the official white house reaction to a plunge in stock prices has a <unk> history of calm right up through friday <eos> treasury secretary nicholas brady said in a statement friday that the stock-market decline does n't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy <eos> the economy he added remains <unk> and the outlook is for continued moderate growth <eos> sound familiar <eos> here 's what ronald reagan said after the N crash the underlying economy remains sound <eos> there is nothing wrong with the economy all the <unk> are up <eos> heard that before <eos> after the N crash herbert <unk> said the fundamental business of the country is on a sound and <unk> basis <eos> james robinson N years old was elected president and chief executive officer of this maker of magnetic recording heads for disk drives <eos>

N who had been acting chief executive since june N will continue as chairman <eos> the former president and chief executive eric w. <unk> resigned in june <eos> the senate 's decision to approve a <unk> deficit-reduction bill without a capital-gains tax cut still leaves open the possibility of <unk> a gains tax reduction this year <eos> late friday night the senate voted N to approve an estimated $ N billion measure that had been stripped of hundreds of provisions that would have widened rather than narrowed the federal budget deficit <eos> lawmakers drastically <unk> the bill to blunt criticism that it was bloated with special-interest tax breaks and spending increases <eos> we 're putting a deficit-reduction bill back in the category of being a deficit-reduction bill said senate budget committee chairman james <unk> d. <unk> <eos> but senate supporters of the <unk> legislation said that other bills would soon be moving through congress that could carry some of the measures that had been cast aside including a capital-gains tax cut <eos> in addition the companion deficit-reduction bill already passed by the house includes a capital-gains provision <eos> house-senate negotiations are likely to begin at <unk> and last for a while <eos> no one can predict exactly what will happen on the house side said senate minority leader robert dole r. <unk> <eos> but he added i believe republicans and democrats will work together to get capital-gains reform this year <eos> white house budget director richard darman told reporters yesterday that the administration would n't push to keep the capital-gains cut in the final version of the bill <eos> we do n't need this as a way to get capital gains he said <eos> house budget committee chairman leon <unk> d. calif said in an interview if that 's the signal that comes from the white house that will help a great deal <eos> the senate 's decision was a setback for president bush and will make approval of a capital-gains tax cut less certain this year <eos> opponents of the cut are playing <unk> <eos> senate majority leader george mitchell d. maine said he was confident that any house-senate agreement on the deficit-reduction legislation would n't include a capital-gains tax cut <eos> and a senior aide to the house ways and means committee where tax legislation <unk> said there are n't any plans to produce another tax bill that could carry a gains tax cut this year <eos> one obvious place to <unk> a capital-gains tax cut and perhaps other popular items stripped from the deficit-reduction bill is the legislation to raise the federal borrowing limit <eos> such legislation must be enacted by the end of the month <eos> the senate bill was <unk> back in an attempt to speed deficit-reduction through congress <eos> because the legislation has n't been completed president bush has until midnight tonight to enact across-the-board spending cuts mandated by the gramm-rudman deficit-reduction law <eos> senators hope that the need to avoid those cuts will pressure the house to agree to the <unk> bill <eos> the house appears reluctant to join the senators <eos> a key is whether house republicans are willing to <unk> to their senate colleagues ' decision to drop many pet provisions <eos> although i am encouraged by the senate action said chairman dan <unk> d. ill of the house ways and means committee it is uncertain whether a clean bill can be achieved in the <unk> conference with the senate <eos> another big question <unk> over the debate is what president bush thinks <eos> he has been <unk> a <unk> bill without a guaranteed vote on his capital-gains tax cut <eos> but republican senators saw no way to overcome a procedural hurdle and <unk> the N votes needed to win the capital-gains issue on the floor so they went ahead with the <unk> bill <eos> the senate bill was stripped of many popular though <unk> provisions a number of which are included in the house-passed bill <eos> these include a child-care initiative and <unk> of <unk> tax breaks for low-income housing and <unk> expenditures <eos> also missing from the senate bill is the house 's repeal of a law called section N that <unk> companies to give <unk> workers comparable health benefits to top paid executives <eos> one <unk> provision that was originally in the senate bill but was cut out because it lost money was the proposal by chairman lloyd <unk> d. texas of the senate finance committee to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts <eos> mr. <unk> said he hopes the senate will consider that measure soon <eos> to the <unk> of some doctors the bill dropped a plan passed by the finance committee that would have <unk> the entire <unk> system under medicare <eos> to the <unk> of many low-income people efforts to boost medicaid funding especially in rural areas also were <unk> <eos> asked why senators were giving up so much new mexico sen. pete <unk> the ranking republican on the senate budget committee said we 're looking like <unk> <eos> things had just gone too far <eos> sen. dole said that the move required sacrifice by every senator <eos> it worked others said because there were no exceptions all <unk> provisions were <unk> <eos> the senate also dropped a plan by its finance committee that would have increased the income <unk> beyond which senior citizens have their social security benefits reduced <eos> in addition the bill dropped a plan to make permanent a N N <unk> tax on long-distance telephone calls <eos> it no longer includes a plan that would have <unk> what remains of the <unk> method of accounting which is used by military contractors to reduce their tax burden <eos> it also drops a provision that would have permitted corporations to use excess pension funds to pay health benefits for current <unk> <eos> also <unk> was a <unk> increase in the maximum <unk> safety and health administration penalties which would have raised $ N million in fiscal N <eos> a provision that would have made the social security administration an independent agency was <unk> <eos> the approval of the senate bill was especially sweet for sen. mitchell who had proposed the streamlining <eos> mr. mitchell 's relations with budget director darman who pushed for a capital-gains cut to be added to the measure have been <unk> since mr. darman chose to <unk> the maine democrat and deal with other lawmakers earlier this year during a dispute over drug funding in the fiscal N supplemental spending bill <eos> the deficit

N N eventually turned out to be <eos> here 's what several leading market experts and money managers say about friday 's action what happens next and what investors should do <eos> joseph <unk> <eos> i 'm the only one who said there would be an october massacre all through late august and september says mr. <unk> once a widely followed market <unk> and still a well-known newsletter writer <eos> everyone will tell you that this time is different from N he says <eos> well in some ways it is different but technically it is just the same <eos> if you 're a <unk> you <unk> the signals <eos> right now they 're telling me to get the hell out and stay out <eos> i see no major support until N <eos> i see a possibility of going to N this month <eos> mr. <unk> says he would n't even think of buying until at least N to N stocks have hit 52-week lows about N stocks hit new lows friday <eos> most people he says have no idea what a massacre pattern looks like <eos> <unk> <unk> <eos> a <unk> analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc. ms. <unk> had warned clients to take their money out of the market before the N crash <eos> friday 's big drop she says was not a crash <eos> this was an october massacre like those that occurred in N and N <eos> now as in those two years her stock market indicators are positive <eos> so she thinks the damage will be short-lived and contained <eos> those <unk> lasted one to four weeks and took the market N N down she says <eos> this is exactly the same thing as far as i 'm concerned <eos> thus she says if the dow jones industrial average dropped below N it would just be a <unk> <eos> my advice is to buy <eos> as she <unk> it the average stock now sells for about N times companies ' earnings <eos> she says that ratio could climb to N given current interest rates and still be within the range of fair value <eos> <unk> davis <eos> friday 's fall marks the start of a bear market says mr. davis president of <unk> davis research inc <eos> but mr. davis whose views are widely respected by money managers says he expects no <unk> crash <eos> there was a unique combination in N he says <eos> margin debt was at a record high <eos> there was tremendous public enthusiasm for stock mutual funds <eos> the main thing was portfolio insurance a mechanical trading system intended to protect an investor against losses <eos> a hundred billion dollars in stock was subject to it <eos> in N such selling contributed to a <unk> effect <eos> today could even be an up day mr. davis says if major brokerage firms agree to <unk> from program trading <eos> over the next several months though he says things look bad <eos> i think the market will be heading down into november he says <eos> we will probably have a year-end rally and then go down again <eos> sort of a <unk> bear market <eos> he expects the downturn to carry the dow jones industrial average down to around N sometime next year <eos> that would be a normal bear market he says <eos> i guess that 's my forecast <eos> leon g. <unk> <eos> i do n't think the market is going through another october <unk> <eos> i do n't think that 's the case at all says mr. <unk> a partner at goldman sachs & co. and chairman of goldman sachs asset management <eos> mr. <unk> sees this as a good time to pick up bargains but he does n't think there 's any need to rush <eos> i expect the market to open weaker monday but then it should find some stability <eos> he <unk> off several major differences between now and two years ago <eos> unlike N interest rates have been falling this year <eos> unlike N the dollar has been strong <eos> and unlike N the economy does n't appear to be in any danger of <unk> <eos> but the economy 's slower growth this year also means the outlook for corporate profits is n't good he says <eos> so it 's a very mixed bag <eos> thus he concludes this is not a good environment to be fully invested in stocks <eos> if i had come into friday on margin or with very little cash in the portfolios i would not do any buying <eos> but we came into friday with a conservative portfolio so i would look to do some modest buying on behalf of clients <eos> we 're going to look for some of the <unk> companies that got <unk> friday <eos> john kenneth <unk> <eos> this is the latest <unk> of the capacity of the financial community for <unk> <unk> says mr. <unk> an economist <eos> i see this as a reaction to the whole junk bond explosion he says <eos> the explosion of junk bonds and takeovers has <unk> a lot of <unk> securities in the hands of investors and loaded the corporations that are the <unk> of takeovers or feared takeovers with huge amounts of debt rather than equity <eos> this has both made investors uneasy and the corporations more vulnerable <eos> nevertheless he says a depression does n't appear likely <eos> there is more <unk> in the economy at large than we commonly <unk> he says <eos> it takes more error now to have a major depression than back in the <unk> much as the financial community and the government may try <eos> mario <unk> <eos> new york money manager mario <unk> an expert at <unk> takeover candidates says that takeovers are n't totally gone <eos> companies are still going to buy companies around the world he says <eos> examples are ford looking at jaguar bellsouth looking at lin broadcasting <eos> these sorts of takeovers do n't require junk bonds or big bank loans to finance them so mr. <unk> figures they will continue <eos> the market was up N N since president bush took office mr. <unk> says so a correction was to be expected <eos> he thinks another crash is unlikely and says he was <unk> at selected stocks during friday 's plunge <eos> stocks that were thrown out just on an emotional basis are a great opportunity this week for guys like me he says <eos> jim rogers <eos> it seems to me that this is the <unk> that has finally <unk> the balloon says mr. rogers a professor of finance at columbia university and former <unk> of one of the most successful hedge funds in history quantum fund <eos> he sees economic problems financial problems ahead for the u.s. with a fairly strong possibility of a recession <eos> friday you could n't sell dollars he says <eos> dealers would give you a quote but then refuse to make the trade <eos> if the dollar stays weak he says that will add

many people now claim to have predicted the N crash <eos> <unk> newsletter writer francis <unk> <unk> actually did it he stated in writing in september N that the dow jones industrial average was likely to decline about N points the following month <eos> mr. <unk> says what happens now will depend a good deal on the federal reserve board <eos> if it promptly cuts the discount rate it charges on loans to banks he says that could quiet things down <eos> if not we could go to N very soon <eos> frank w. <unk> <eos> stock prices would still have to go down some additional amount before we become positive on stocks says mr. <unk> president and managing director of renaissance investment management inc. in cincinnati <eos> renaissance which manages about $ N billion drew stiff criticism from many clients earlier this year because it pulled entirely out of stocks at the beginning of the year and thus missed a strong rally <eos> renaissance is keeping its money entirely in cash equivalents primarily u.s. treasury bills <eos> <unk> probably are the right place to be he says <eos> regarding the oct. N letter to the editor from rep. tom <unk> chairman of the house subcommittee on employment and housing alleging <eos> N that your sept. N editorial <unk> committees was <unk> inaccurate and deliberately misleading <eos> i thought your editorial was <unk> accurate and deliberately <unk> <eos> N that mr. <unk> supported the rights of the witnesses to take the fifth amendment <eos> yes he did <eos> as i watched him on <unk> i heard him speak those lovely words about the bill of rights which he quotes from the <unk> of the hearings <eos> he did repeat those nice <unk> several times as an indication of his support for the constitution <eos> he used about N words defending the witnesses ' constitutional rights <eos> unfortunately by my rough guess he used better than N words <unk> <unk> on the witnesses for exercising the fifth <eos> he <unk> his <unk> of constitutional meat between large <unk> of <unk> commentary <eos> as your editorial <unk> pointed out samuel <unk> former hud secretary and <unk> wilson mr. <unk> 's former aide are currently being held up to <unk> for taking the fifth amendment <eos> that certainly is not the supposed distorted reading indicated by mr. <unk> <eos> N that his committee does not deal with any possible criminal activity at hud <eos> my colleagues and i fully realize we are not a court etc <eos> <unk> <unk> <eos> by any reasonable man <unk> mr. <unk> and his colleagues have a whole bunch of people tried and convicted <eos> apparently their verdict is in <eos> right now they 're pursuing evidence <eos> that 's not a bad way to proceed just somewhat different from standard american practice <eos> how was that practice referred to when i was in school <eos> <unk> yes something called a star chamber <eos> of course mr. <unk> <unk> protest that his subcommittee simply seeks information for legislative change <eos> no doubt that 's partially true <eos> everything that mr. <unk> says in his letter is partially true <eos> he 's right about his subcommittee 's responsibilities when it comes to obtaining information from prior hud officials <eos> but if his explanation of <unk> is true why is his investigation so <unk> as to identify criminal activity <eos> why not simply questions designed to identify sources and causes of waste and <unk> <eos> such as what happened when congress wanted to know about $ N toilet seats or whatever they supposedly cost <eos> no mr. <unk> 's complaints simply wo n't wash <eos> N that the journal <unk> the <unk> fraud waste <unk> <unk> and abuse of the public that took place while mr. <unk> was secretary of hud etc. and so forth <eos> no to my mind the journal did not defend <unk> fraud waste <unk> <unk> and abuse of the public trust <eos> it defended appropriate constitutional <unk> and practical common sense <eos> the problem which the journal so <unk> pointed out in a number of articles is not the likes of mr. <unk> who after all is really a bit player on the stage but the attempt by congress to enhance itself into a <unk> body <eos> of course we 've also got a judiciary that seeks the same objective <eos> the system is the problem not an individual member <eos> individuals can always have their hands <unk> <eos> it 's when such <unk> does n't occur that we 've got trouble <eos> i do not by any means defend hud management <eos> but i think the kind of congressional investigation that has been pursued is a far greater danger to american <unk> of liberty and freedom than any <unk> and yes maybe <unk> within hud could possibly generate <eos> the last time i saw a similar congressional hearing was when <unk> <unk> joe <unk> did his work <eos> raymond <unk> <eos> <unk> n.j <eos> i disagree with the statement by mr. <unk> that one should not draw an adverse <unk> against former hud officials who <unk> their fifth amendment privilege against <unk> in congressional hearings <eos> the fifth amendment states in relevant part that no person shall be <unk> in any criminal case to be a witness against himself <eos> this privilege against <unk> <unk> the drawing of an adverse <unk> against a criminal defendant who chooses not to testify <eos> thus in a criminal case a prosecutor can not comment on a defendant 's failure to testify nor can the defendant be <unk> to take the stand as a witness thus forcing him to take the fifth <eos> the privilege however has been limited in <unk> with its plain language to protect the defendant in criminal matters only <eos> the supreme court and some states have specifically recognized that the fifth amendment does not preclude the <unk> where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause <eos> <unk> v. <unk> N u.s. N N <eos> thus in a civil case a defendant may be called as a witness he may be forced to testify or take the fifth and his taking of the fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse <unk> against him in the civil matter <eos> he may take the fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and <unk> belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution <eos> allowing the defendant to take the fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony <unk> him in the civil matter but because the testimony in the civil matter could be <unk> used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution <eos> <unk> the risk of such prosecution a court may order the defendant to testify <eos> thus when mr. <unk> asserted the fifth in a <unk> proceeding particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel one must conclude that he held a <unk> <unk> belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution <eos> the subcommittee congress and the american public have every right to draw the adverse <unk> and to <unk> with mr. <unk> 's own belief that his testimony could help <unk> him of a crime <eos> drawing the adverse <unk> in a <unk> congressional hearing does not <unk> the fifth amendment shield against <unk> <eos> clark s. <unk> jr <eos> <unk> park <unk> <eos> it was friday the 13th and the stock market plummeted nearly N points <eos> just a <unk> <eos> or is <unk> fear of the number N justified <eos> in <unk> a so-called friday the 13th effect has been set up and shot down by different professors <eos> robert <unk> and <unk> <unk> professors of finance at the university of miami found evidence that the market is spooked by friday the 13th <eos> but their study which <unk> the N period has since been shown to be <unk> by an <unk> choice of data <eos> in the <unk> the market took falls nine times in a row on friday the <unk> <eos> but the date tends to be a plus not a minus for stocks according to yale <unk> a <unk> of stock market <unk> <eos> another study found that the N <unk> the 13th in the N period had higher than average returns higher even than <unk> in general which tend to be strong days for stock prices <eos> on the only other friday the 13th this year the dow jones industrial average rose about four points <eos> professor <unk> says the original study titled friday the 13th part <unk> was published <unk> <eos> in a similar <unk> he adds that the anniversary of the N crash and saturday 's full moon could have played a part too in friday 's market activity <eos> <unk> of those during the N crash that as stock prices plummeted and trading activity <unk> some phone calls to market makers in over-the-counter stocks went <unk> <eos> we could n't get dealers to answer their phones said robert king senior vice president of otc trading at <unk> co. in atlanta <eos> it was like the friday before black monday two years ago <eos> whether <unk> phone calls had any effect or not nasdaq stocks sank far less than those on the new york and american exchanges <eos> nonetheless the nasdaq composite index suffered its biggest point decline of the year and its sixth worst ever <unk> N or N N to N <eos> ten points of the drop occurred during the last N minutes of trading <eos> by comparison the new york stock exchange composite tumbled N N friday and the american stock exchange composite fell N N <eos> on oct.

were widely criticized two years ago following complaints from investors who could n't reach their brokers or trade in the chaos of the crash <eos> peter dapuzzo head of retail equity trading at

two years ago we were carrying huge inventories and that was the big <unk> <eos> i do n't know of anyone carrying big inventories now said mr. king of <unk> <eos> tony <unk> head of equity trading at

<eos> the pace of trading was orderly he said <eos> nasdaq 's small order execution system worked <unk> as did the automated system for larger trades according to mr. <unk> <eos> nevertheless the

like to see that initiative and i have n't <eos> there is n't a big shot an agenda <eos> a few hours later the stock market dropped N points <eos> politicians tried to finger each other for the blame although many analysts doubt that washington was <unk> responsible for wall street 's woes <eos> but mr. butcher 's comments make one thing clear some on wall street wonder if anyone is in charge of economic policy <eos> consider this <eos> by N p.m. tonight president bush must order $ N billion of automatic across-the-board cuts in government spending to comply with the gramm-rudman budget law <eos> the cuts are necessary because congress and the administration have failed to reach agreement on a <unk> bill <eos> we simply do n't have strong leadership to try to reduce the deficit and make tough choices house budget committee chairman leon <unk> d. calif said yesterday on nbc news 's meet the press <eos> for the last two weeks the bush administration and the federal reserve have been engaged in a <unk> battle over international economic policy <eos> the administration has been trying to push the dollar lower the fed has been <unk> <eos> one of the things that continues to worry me is this monetary <unk> between the treasury department and the federal reserve board said lawrence <unk> a bear stearns & co. economist on abc 's this week <eos> the administration has sent out confusing signals about its response to a recent spate of airline takeovers <eos> last month transportation secretary sam skinner forced northwest airlines to reduce a stake held by <unk> royal dutch airlines <eos> but he has since run into opposition from the treasury and the white house over that decision <eos> and he has kept <unk> on how his decision might affect a bid for united airlines which includes a big stake by british airways plc <eos> some analysts say uncertainty about washington 's anti-takeover policy was one reason that financing for the united airlines takeover fell through the event that triggered the market drop <eos> in many ways the backdrop to friday 's stock decline is <unk> similar to that of october N 's <unk> crash <eos> then as now the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of taking hold <eos> the treasury was locked in a battle over international economic policy although at that time it was with west german officials rather than the federal reserve <eos> and concern about official actions aimed at takeovers then by the <unk> house ways and means committee rather than the transportation department were making markets nervous <eos> the N crash brought the reagan administration and democratic lawmakers to the table for the first budget summit resulting in a two-year plan to reduce the deficit by more than $ N billion even though the deficit actually rose by nearly $ N billion during that period <eos> but barring further drops in the market this week a similar outcome does n't seem likely this year <eos> lawmakers and administration officials agree that friday 's drop by itself is n't enough to force both sides back to the table to try to reach a deficit-reduction agreement that would be more serious and more far-reaching than last spring 's <unk> plan which still is n't fully implemented <eos> one of the biggest reasons that new talks are n't likely to come about is that as everyone learned in N the economy and the market can survive a one-day <unk> tumble <eos> everybody thought we were looking at a <unk> of N that we were looking at a recession rep. <unk> said yesterday in an interview <eos> that did not happen <eos> they learned they could survive it without much problem <eos> but administration officials privately agree with mr. <unk> who said a <unk> drop this week is going to force the president and congress to take a much harder look at fiscal policy <eos> in that case there will be plenty of blame to go around <eos> there is an underlying concern on the part of the american people and there should be that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that congress has been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut said senate finance committee chairman lloyd <unk> d. texas <eos> nevertheless it clearly will take more than friday 's 190-point decline to overcome the bitter feelings that have developed between lawmakers and white house budget director richard darman over the capital-gains fight <eos> hill democrats are particularly angry over mr. bush 's claim that the capital-gains cut was part of april 's budget accord and his insistence on combining it with the deficit-reduction legislation <eos> there is no prospect of any so-called grand compromise or deal next year because the administration simply did n't live up to this year 's deal senate majority leader george mitchell d. maine said yesterday on cbs news 's face the nation <eos> during last week 's <unk> on the <unk> bill and the capital-gains issue there were signs that senate republicans and the administration were at odds <eos> at the very moment that senate republicans were negotiating a deal to exclude capital gains from the deficit-reduction legislation white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters that it was the president 's policy to include it <eos> when an agreement was reached to strip capital gains from the legislation oregon sen. bob packwood the ranking gop member of the <unk> senate finance committee hailed it <eos> asked if the administration agreed he <unk> replied the <unk> will have to speak for itself <eos> friday 's market tumble could spur action on <unk> the house and senate versions of the deficit-reduction measure a process that is n't expected to begin until tomorrow at the <unk> <eos> senate republicans expressed the hope that the house would follow the lead of the senate which on friday agreed to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that would have increased the fiscal N deficit <eos> the market needs a strong signal that we 're serious about deficit reduction and the best way to do that is for the house of representatives to strip their bill of similar provisions sen. warren <unk> r. <unk> said yesterday <eos> the white house office of management and budget whose calculations determine whether the gramm-rudman targets are met estimated that the house-passed deficit-reduction measure would cut the fiscal N <unk> by $ N billion almost half of the congressional budget office 's estimate of $ N billion <eos> rep. <unk> said that <unk> 's figure would still be enough to avoid permanent across-the-board cuts but added we 're getting very close to the margins here <eos> no one in washington was willing to take the blame for <unk> friday 's drop in the stock market <eos> but some players were quick to seize the moment <eos> before the sun had set on friday richard <unk> the <unk> chief economist of the u.s. chamber of commerce issued a statement <unk> the drop in stock prices to the senate decision to postpone action on capital gains <eos> investors who had been holding assets in anticipation of a more favorable time to sell were

boston lawyer christopher sullivan as he watched the market plunge on a big screen in front of a brokerage firm <eos> but he 's not so sure about everyone else <eos> i think on monday the small

's long-awaited entry today into the notebook field is expected to put immediate heat on others in the market especially zenith electronics corp. the current market leader and on a <unk> of promising <unk> <eos> compaq 's series of <unk> <unk> a trend toward <unk> in the personal computer market <eos> one manufacturer already has produced a <unk> computer called a <unk> and two others have introduced even smaller <unk> <eos> but those machines are still considered <unk> with <unk> only a <unk> could love and screens to match <eos> compaq 's <unk> by contrast may be the first in their weight class not to <unk> on features found in much bigger machines <eos> analysts say they 're faster and carry more memory than anything else of their size on the market and they 're priced aggressively at $ N to $ N <eos> all of this comes in a machine that <unk> only six pounds and fits <unk> into most <unk> <eos> in recent months compaq 's competition including zenith toshiba corp. tandy corp. and nec corp. all have introduced <unk> that weigh approximately the same and that are called <unk> perhaps <unk> <eos> one analyst noting that most such machines are about two inches thick takes exception to the name <eos> this is n't quite a notebook i call it a <unk> he says <eos> that ca n't be said of the $ N <unk> computer introduced a few weeks ago by grid systems corp. a unit of tandy <eos> instead of a <unk> it features a writing surface an electronic <unk> and the ability to read block printing <eos> at N N pounds it may be too <unk> named but it nevertheless opens up the kind of marketing possibilities that make analysts <unk> <eos> <unk> are n't far behind <eos> <unk> corp. 's portfolio introduced in europe two months ago and in the u.s. in early september <unk> less than a pound costs a mere $ N and runs on three <unk> <unk> yet has the power to run some <unk> and word processing programs <eos> some critics however say its ability to run <unk> programs is restricted by a limited memory <eos> <unk> computer corp. meanwhile has introduced a much more sophisticated <unk> that can run lotus N and other sophisticated software programs but costs five times as much <eos> at stake is what mike <unk> compaq 's president of north america operations calls the <unk> <unk> of the computer industry the search for a real computer in a package so small you can take it everywhere <eos> the market is so new nobody knows yet how big it can be <eos> i 've had a lot of people trying to sell me services to find out how big it is says tom <unk> director of marketing for grid <eos> whether it 's $ N billion or $ N billion it does n't matter <eos> it 's huge <eos> consider the growth of <unk> which now <unk> N N of all personal computer sales <eos> <unk> generally anything under N pounds have become the fastest-growing personal computer segment with sales doubling this year <eos> responding to that demand however has led to a variety of <unk> <eos> making computers smaller often means <unk> memory <eos> it also has <unk> use of the faster more powerful microprocessors found in increasing numbers of desktop machines <eos> size and weight considerations also have limited screen displays <eos> the competitive <unk> can get pretty <unk> at times <eos> a

a problem <unk> also encountered in focus groups admits <unk> <unk> director of marketing <eos> <unk> trying to avoid the <unk> label responded with the tag line the <unk> pc a very big computer <eos> despite the <unk> few question the <unk> of the move to small machines that do n't make <unk> <eos> toward that end experts say the real battle will take place between <unk> players like toshiba zenith and now compaq <eos> compaq 's new machines are considered a direct threat to start-up firms like <unk> inc. which introduced in june a computer that like compaq 's uses an intel N microprocessor and has a hard disk drive <eos> but the <unk> product is twice as heavy and costs more than compaq 's <eos> compaq 's announcement also <unk> trouble for zenith which last year had N N of the u.s. laptop market but recently agreed to sell its computer business to cie. des machines bull the french government-owned computer maker <eos> zenith holders will vote in december on the

chief executive officer notes <unk> that zenith 's $ N <unk> uses an <unk> <unk> <unk> disk <unk> compaq 's new machines use the more common N <unk> disk <eos> john p. frank president of zenith data systems simply <unk> off such criticism noting that N <unk> <unk> were also <unk> when they first replaced <unk> disks <eos> we do n't look at it as not being a standard we look at it as a new standard he argues <eos> analysts do n't see it that way <eos> i ca n't imagine that you 'll talk to anyone who wo n't tell you this is <unk> for compaq and a <unk> for everyone else says gene <unk> president of professional marketing management inc <eos> adds bill <unk> senior industry analyst for <unk> a high-technology market research firm we basically think that these are very hot products <eos> the problem compaq is going to have is that they wo n't be able to make enough of them <eos> compaq 's machines include the N <unk> <unk> disk drive a <unk> screen that is only <unk> thick and an internal expansion <unk> for a <unk> in other words almost all the <unk> of a typical office machine <eos> others undoubtedly will follow but most analysts believe compaq has at least a six-month lead on the competition <eos> toshiba 's line of <unk> for example features the <unk> which is in the same weight class but is much slower and has less memory and the <unk> which also uses a N microprocessor but which <unk> almost twice as much and is three times the size <eos> a third model marketed in japan may hit the u.s. by the end of the first quarter of N but by then analysts say compaq will have established itself as one of three major players <eos> what about big blue <eos> international business machines corp. analysts say has been burned twice in trying to enter the laptop market and shows no signs of trying to get into <unk> anytime soon <eos> honeywell inc. and international business machines corp. received air force contracts to develop integrated circuits for use in

's lead said it is backing out of <unk> programs with three airlines <eos> the garden city n.y. <unk> company said it wo n't renew contracts with nwa inc. 's northwest airlines unit pan am corp. 's pan american world airways unit and <unk> airlines at the end of this year <eos> but it remains involved in programs with amr corp. 's american airlines unit and delta air lines <eos> industry estimates put <unk> 's annual cost of all five programs at between $ N million and $ N million <eos> a spokesman for <unk> would n't specify the costs but said the three airlines being dropped account for far less than half of the total <eos> budget rent a car corp. of chicago and national car rental systems inc. of minneapolis both said they had no plans to follow suit <eos> in fact budget indicated it saw some benefit to staying involved in these programs in which <unk> earn <unk> miles and <unk> can get <unk> discounts <eos> i can not see how this news by hertz and <unk> can not benefit budget 's programs said bob wilson budget 's vice president marketing planning <eos> northwest and <unk> are two of the five airlines with which budget has agreements <eos> national also <unk> in the northwest <unk> program along with four other airlines including delta and usair group inc. 's usair unit <eos> a month ago hertz of park <unk> n.j. said that it would drop its marketing agreements at year end with delta america west and texas air corp. 's continental airlines and eastern airlines and that <unk> with american airlines ual inc 's united airlines and usair also would be ended sometime after dec. N <eos> at the time hertz said its annual fees to those airlines amounted to $ N million and that the value of redeemed <unk> topped $ N million <eos> analysts and competitors however doubt the numbers were that high <eos> budget said its <unk> costs are substantially below <unk> 's level <eos> robert d. <unk> <unk> vice president of marketing said the proliferation and costs attached to <unk> programs have significantly diminished their value <eos> this year has been difficult for both hertz and <unk> said charles <unk> <unk> industry analyst at alex brown & sons <eos> they 've been looking to get their costs down and this is a fairly <unk> way to do it he said <eos> cbs inc. is cutting the pat <unk> show down to one hour from its current N minutes <eos> cbs insisted the move was n't a setback for the program which is the network 's first entry into the <unk> talk show format since N <eos> i have every intention of making this the best possible show and having it run one hour is the best way to it said rod <unk> who was named vice president of late night entertainment in august <eos> this will raise the energy level of the show <eos> cbs will continue to program <unk> shows to follow the <unk> hour <eos> but cbs news will extend its <unk> <unk> by N minutes and begin at N a.m <eos> the show despite a promising start has slipped badly in the weekly ratings as compiled by a.c. nielsen co. finishing far below tonight on nbc a unit of general electric co. and <unk> on <unk> a unit of capital cities\/abc inc <eos> further <unk> the <unk> audience is the addition of the <unk> hall show syndicated by paramount communications inc <eos> tandem computers inc. preparing to fight with international business machines corp. for a piece of the mainframe business said it expects to post higher revenue and earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter ended sept. N <eos> tandem said it expects to report revenue of about $ N million and earnings of N cents to N cents a share <eos> the results which are in line with analysts ' estimates reflect a continued improvement in our u.s. business said james <unk> tandem 's chief executive officer <eos> in the year-earlier period tandem reported net income of $ N million or N cents a share on revenue of $ N million <eos> tandem expects to report the full results for the quarter next week <eos> analysts have predicted that the cupertino calif. company will report revenue of $ N million to $ N million and earnings of N cents to N cents a share <eos> commenting on the results for the quarter mr. <unk> said the strength of the company 's domestic business came as a surprise to him noting that sales in every region of the u.s. exceeded our plan <eos> the company 's u.s. performance was helped by a record quarter for new customers he said <eos> tandem makes <unk> computers machines with <unk> backup systems that run stock exchanges networks of automatic <unk> and other complex computer systems <eos> tomorrow the company is scheduled to announce its most powerful computer ever which for the first time will bring it into direct competition with makers of mainframe computers <eos> tandem 's new high-end computer is called <unk> <eos> prices for the machine which can come in various <unk> are $ N million to $ N million <eos> analysts expect the new computer to <unk> a hefty <unk> of business away from ibm the longtime leader in mainframes <eos> we believe they could <unk> perhaps two to three billion dollars from ibm over the next few years said george weiss an analyst at the gartner group <eos> that will spur tandem 's growth <eos> i 'd be disappointed if the company grew by less than N N next year said john <unk> an analyst at goldman sachs & co <eos> ibm is expected to respond to tandem 's <unk> by discounting its own mainframes which analysts say are roughly three times the price of a comparable system from tandem <eos> obviously ibm can give bigger discounts to users immediately said mr. weiss <eos> but mr. <unk> questions whether that will be enough to stop tandem 's first mainframe from taking on some of the functions that large organizations previously sought from big blue 's machines <eos> the answer is n't price reductions but new systems he said <eos> nevertheless tandem faces a variety of challenges the biggest being that customers generally view the company 's computers as <unk> to ibm 's mainframes <eos> even mr. <unk> is reluctant to abandon this notion insisting that tandem 's new machines are n't <unk> for ibm 's mainframes <eos> we 're after a little bigger niche he said <eos> do n't jump yet <eos> the stock market 's <unk> may turn out to be good news for the economy <eos> in one wild hour of trading the market managed to accomplish what the bush administration has been trying to do unsuccessfully for weeks <eos> it is forcing the federal reserve to ease its grip on credit and it took the wind out of a previously <unk> dollar <eos> the resulting decline in interest rates and the value of the dollar could <unk> american business indeed the entire economy <eos> this may sound <unk> optimistic <eos> after all until a few years ago the stock market was viewed as a barometer of the national economy <eos> when it went down by all tradition the economy followed <eos> that has changed partly because the two years following the worst stock-market plunge in history have been reasonably comfortable <eos> the N crash was a false alarm however you view it says university of chicago economist victor <unk> <eos> the market seems increasingly <unk> from the rest of the nation <eos> its <unk> ca n't be <unk> to fundamental business conditions nor do they appear to <unk> major shifts in the economy <eos> the market today has a life of its own john <unk> chairman of international business machines corp. said saturday <eos> there 's nothing rational about this kind of action <eos> of course the health of the economy will be threatened if the market continues to dive this week <eos> sharply falling stock prices do reduce consumer wealth damage business confidence and discourage the foreign investors upon whom the u.s. now relies for financial <unk> <eos> the financial-services industry was battered by the N crash <eos> what 's more although the stock market is far less <unk> today than two years ago the u.s. economy is weaker <eos> growth is slower <eos> profits are softer <eos> debt burdens are heavier <eos> but if the stock market does n't continue to plummet the beneficial effects of lower interest rates and a lower dollar may well dominate <eos> the fed which until friday had been <unk> moves to ease credit is now poised to pour money into the economy if needed to <unk> the markets <eos> fed officials may protest that this does n't necessarily mean a fundamental change in their interest-rate policies <eos> but the experience of the N crash suggests the fed is likely to bring down short-term interest rates in its effort to calm markets <eos> anticipating the fed 's move money traders lowered a key interest rate known as the federal funds rate to N N late friday down from N N the day before <eos> tiny movements in the rate which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans are usually among the few visible tracks that the fed leaves on the monetary markets <eos> the dollar also began to decline friday as the stock market 's plunge caused some investors to <unk> their desire to invest in the u.s. <eos> treasury officials have been arguing for months that the dollar 's strength was out of <unk> with economic fundamentals threatening to <unk> the export boom that has sustained manufacturers for several years <eos> the market drop has now apparently convinced foreign investors that the treasury was right about the <unk> dollar <eos> a modest drop in the dollar only a modest one mind you would be welcomed by the u.s. <eos> that was n't the case in N when the dollar was so weak that some economists and government officials seriously worried that it might collapse producing panic among foreign investors and <unk> the flow of foreign capital to the u.s. <eos> another big difference between N and N is n't so <unk> <eos> in the third quarter of N the economy <unk> at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of N N <eos> the consensus among economists is that it grew a much more sluggish N N in the third quarter of N which ended two weeks ago <eos> the plunge in stock prices is happening at a time when the economy has already slowed down says economist lawrence <unk> of <unk> group a <unk> <unk> pa. forecasting company <eos> a lot of <unk> demand is gone <eos> consumer spending did drop in the months following black monday N but only slightly and for a short period of time recalls mr. <unk> a longtime student of business cycles <eos> that was offset by strength elsewhere <eos> the effects were much less severe and less prolonged than some had feared or expected <eos> today he <unk> exports and business investment spending may be insufficient to pick up the slack if stock prices sink this week and if consumers <unk> in reaction <eos> what 's more the corporate borrowing binge has n't <unk> in the past two years <eos> we 've had two more years of significant accumulation of debt just at the time when earnings are being squeezed mr. <unk> notes <eos> the more a company relies on borrowed money the greater its <unk> to an economic slowdown <eos> a company with a strong balance sheet can withstand an unanticipated storm a highly leveraged company may end up in bankruptcy court <eos> the fed of course knows that very well hence its <unk> to pump credit into the economy this morning <eos> but in the process the fed risks <unk> inflation <eos> even before friday 's events harvard university economist benjamin <unk> was arguing that the fed wo n't be able to live up to its tough words on eliminating inflation because of its responsibility to protect fragile financial markets banks and highly leveraged corporations <eos> the biggest threat on the economic horizon right now is n't recession he reasons it 's an <unk> of <unk> inflation <eos> in the end the N collapse suggested the economy does n't move in <unk> with stock prices <eos> the economy does however depend on the confidence of businesses consumers and foreign investors <eos> a panic on wall street does n't exactly <unk> confidence <eos> surveys suggested that consumer confidence was high before friday <eos> a 190-point drop is n't likely to make much of a <unk> <unk> that a few times over though and it will <eos> if the reactions of executives gathered saturday at hot springs va. for the business council meetings are typical business leaders were n't overly rattled by friday 's decline <eos> and if foreign investors become a <unk> more cautious well the dollar 's recent strength suggests that the u.s. can stand it <eos> on the bottom line the most <unk> fact for the economic outlook is that we 've been through this before <eos> two years ago about the only point of comparison was the N crash and the subsequent depression <eos> the <unk> had a <unk> audience <eos> the prosperity that followed black monday permits a more optimistic view today <eos> at the very least the establishment here is taking comfort from the nation 's success in handling the last <unk> <eos> as sen. lloyd <unk> d. texas observed yesterday the fed avoided a <unk> last time <eos> they are more sophisticated this time <eos> the chemical industry is expected to report that profits eroded in the third quarter because of <unk> prices in the commodity end of the business <eos> producers of commodity chemicals the basic chemicals produced in huge volumes for other manufacturers have seen sharp inventory cutting by buyers <eos> once the chief beneficiaries of the industry 's now <unk> boom these producers also will be reporting against exceptionally strong performances in the N third quarter <eos> for some of these companies this will be the first quarter with year-to-year negative comparisons says leonard <unk> a chemical industry analyst at prudential <unk> research <eos> this could be the first of five or six down quarters <eos> perhaps most prominent dow chemical co. which as of midyear had racked up eight consecutive record quarters is expected to report that profit decreased in the latest quarter from a year earlier if only by a <unk> <eos> though dow has aggressively diversified into specialty chemicals and pharmaceuticals the company still has a big stake in polyethylene which is used in packaging and <unk> <eos> analysts ' third-quarter estimates for the midland mich. company are between $ N a share and $ N a share compared with $ N a year ago when profit was $ N million on sales of $ N billion <eos> a dow spokeswoman declined to comment on the estimates <eos> at the investment firm of smith barney harris upham & co. the <unk> segment is seen pulling down overall profit for N companies representative of the whole industry by N N to N N <eos> you will find the commodities off more than the others and the diversified companies about even or slightly better says james wilbur a smith barney analyst <eos> first boston corp. projects that N of the N companies it follows will report lower profit <eos> most of the N have big <unk> operations <eos> still some industry giants are expected to report continuing gains largely because so much of their business is outside commodity chemicals <eos> du pont co. is thought to have had steady profit growth in white <unk> fibers and <unk> <eos> moreover the wilmington del. company is helped when prices weaken on the commodity chemicals it buys for its own production needs such as <unk> <eos> analysts are divided over whether du pont will report much of a gain in the latest quarter from its <unk> inc. oil company <eos> the estimates for du pont range from $ N to $ N a share <eos> in the N third quarter the company earned $ N million or $ N a share on sales of $ N billion <eos> du pont declined to comment <eos> monsanto co. too is expected to continue reporting higher profit even though its sales of crop chemicals were hurt in the latest quarter by drought in northern europe and the western u.s. <eos> the st. <unk> company is expected to report again that losses in its <unk> searle & co. pharmaceutical business are narrowing <eos> searle continued to operate in the red through the first half of the year but monsanto has said it expects searle to post a profit for all of N <eos> most estimates for monsanto run between $ N and $ N a share <eos> a year ago the company posted third-quarter profit of $ N million or $ N a share on sales of $ N billion <eos> monsanto declined to comment <eos> but the <unk> producers are caught on the downside of a pricing cycle <eos> by some accounts on wall street and in the industry the inventory reductions are near an end which may <unk> firmer demand <eos> but <unk> say growing production capacity could keep pressure on prices into the early 1990s <eos> in the latest quarter at least profit is expected to fall sharply <eos> for <unk> inc. how far down it is we do n't know says leslie <unk> at salomon brothers <eos> the projections are in the neighborhood of N cents a share to N cents compared with a restated $ N a share a year earlier when profit was $ N million on sales of $ N million <eos> <unk> faces lower prices for its mainstay product <unk> while it goes forward with a heavy capital investment program to bolster its raw material supply and develop new uses for <unk> whose markets include the packaging and automobile industries <eos> the company based in wilmington del. is <unk> by montedison s.p a. milan which has an offer outstanding for the <unk> shares it does n't already own <eos> at quantum chemical corp. new york the trouble is lower prices for polyethylene higher debt costs and the <unk> of an important plant due to an explosion <eos> some analysts hedge their estimates for quantum because it is n't known when the company will book certain one-time charges <eos> but the estimates range from break-even to N cents a share <eos> in the N third quarter quantum earned $ N million or $ N a share on sales of $ N million <eos> another big polyethylene producer union carbide corp. is expected to post profit of between $ N a share and $ N compared

a unit of mcgraw-hill inc. new york <eos> thursday 's report on the september consumer price index is expected to rise although not as sharply as the N N gain reported friday in the producer price index <eos> that gain was being cited as a reason the stock market was down early in friday 's session before it got started on its reckless 190-point plunge <eos> economists are divided as to how much manufacturing strength they expect to see in september reports on industrial production and capacity utilization also due tomorrow <eos> meanwhile september housing starts due wednesday are thought to have inched upward <eos> there 's a possibility of a surprise in the trade report said michael <unk> director of research at <unk> <eos> a widening of the deficit if it were combined with a <unk> strong dollar would <unk> trade problems but the dollar weakened friday as stocks plummeted <eos> in any event mr. <unk> and many others say that the easy gains in narrowing the trade gap have already been made <eos> trade is definitely going to be more politically sensitive over the next six or seven months as improvement begins to slow he said <eos> exports are thought to have risen strongly in august but probably not enough to offset the jump in imports economists said <eos> views on manufacturing strength are split between economists who read september 's low level of factory job growth as a sign of a slowdown and those who use the somewhat more <unk> total employment figures in their calculations <eos> the wide range of estimates for the industrial output number <unk> the differences the forecasts run from a drop of N N to an increase of N N according to <unk> <eos> a rebound in energy prices which helped push up the producer price index is expected to do the same in the consumer price report <eos> the consensus view expects a N N increase in the september <unk> after a flat reading in august <eos> robert h. <unk> an economist for lloyd 's bank in new york is among those expecting a more moderate gain in the <unk> than in prices at the producer level <eos> auto prices had a big effect in the <unk> and at the <unk> level they wo n't he said <eos> food prices are expected to be unchanged but energy costs jumped as much as N N said gary <unk> economist at <unk> financial group <eos> he also says he thinks core inflation which <unk> the volatile food

regulators in the nine u.s. states where farmers operates <eos> the proposed acquisition is part of sir james goldsmith 's unfriendly takeover attempt for b.a.t industries plc the british tobacco retailing paper and financial services concern that is parent of los angeles-based farmers <eos> in an attempt to <unk> u.s. regulators ' concern over a goldsmith acquisition of farmers sir james in august agreed to sell farmers to axa if he is successful in acquiring b.a.t <eos> as part of the agreement axa agreed to invest $ N billion in <unk> investments ltd. sir james 's acquisition vehicle <eos> of the total $ N billion to be paid to <unk> by axa about $ N billion will come from available resources of axa 's parent <unk> group $ N billion will be in the form of notes issued by axa and the remaining $ N billion will be in long-term bank loans <eos> in an interview thursday <unk> bebear chairman and chief executive officer of axa said his group has already obtained assurances from a group of banks led by cie financiere de paribas that they can provide the loan portion of the financing <eos> the other banking companies in the group are credit lyonnais societe generale bankamerica corp. and citicorp he said <eos> mr. bebear said <unk> group has more than $ N billion of <unk> assets that we can and will sell to help pay off debt from the acquisition <eos> he said the assets to be sold would be <unk> assets including a beer company and a real estate firm and would n't include any pieces of farmers <eos> we wo n't put any burden on farmers he said <eos> the amended filings also point out that under a new agreement <unk> has an <unk> obligation to sell farmers to axa upon an acquisition of b.a.t <eos> we hope that with what we did the regulators will not need to evaluate <unk> and they can directly look at the agreement with us because <unk> wo n't be an owner of farmers at anytime mr. bebear said <eos> any change of control in farmers needs approval of the insurance commissioners in the nine states where farmers and its related companies are incorporated <eos> the amended filings were required because of the new agreement between axa and <unk> and to reflect the extension that sir james received last month under british takeover rules to complete his proposed acquisition <eos> <unk> dropped its initial # N billion $ N billion takeover bid after it received the extension but said it would launch a new bid if and when the <unk> sale of farmers to axa receives regulatory approval <eos> a spokesman for b.a.t said of the amended filings that it would appear that nothing <unk> has changed <eos> the new financing structure is still a <unk> leveraged one and axa still plans to take out N N of farmers ' earnings as dividends to service their debt <eos> that dividend is almost double the N N currently taken out of farmers by b.a.t the spokesman added <eos> it would have severe implications for farmers ' policy holders <eos> to fend off sir james 's advances b.a.t has proposed a sweeping restructuring that would <unk> it to a tobacco and financial services concern <eos> dismal sales at general motors corp. dragged the u.s. car and truck market down below year-ago levels in early october the first sales period of the N model year <eos> the eight major domestic auto makers sold N north <unk> cars in the first N days of october a N N drop from a year earlier <eos> domestically built truck sales were down N N to N <unk> vans and sport utility vehicles <eos> the heavy use of incentives to clear out N models appears to have taken the steam at least initially out of N model sales which began officially oct. N <eos> this appears particularly true at gm which had strong sales in august and september but saw its early october car and truck results fall N N from last year 's unusually high level <eos> overall sales of all <unk> vehicles fell N N from a year ago <eos> without gm overall sales for the other u.s. <unk> were roughly flat with N results <eos> some of the u.s. auto makers have already adopted incentives on many N models but they may have to broaden their programs to keep sales up <eos> we 've created a condition where without incentives it 's a tough market said tom kelly sales manager for bill <unk> chevrolet in dearborn mich <eos> car sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annual selling rate of N million vehicles the lowest since october N <eos> the poor performance contrasts with a robust selling rate of almost eight million last month <eos> furthermore dealers contacted late last week said they could n't see any immediate impact on sales of friday 's steep market decline <eos> gm 's domestic car sales dropped N N and its domestic trucks were down an even <unk> N N from the same period a year ago <eos> all of the gm divisions except cadillac showed big declines <eos> cadillac posted a N N increase despite new competition from lexus the <unk> luxury-car division of toyota motor corp <eos> lexus sales were n't available the cars are imported and toyota reports their sales only at <unk> <eos> the sales drop for the no. N car maker may have been caused in part by the end in september of dealer incentives that gm offered in addition to consumer rebates and <unk> financing a company spokesman said <eos> last year gm had a different program in place that continued rewarding dealers until all the N models had been sold <eos> aside from gm other car makers posted generally mixed results <eos> ford motor co. had a N N drop in domestic car sales but a N N increase in domestic truck sales <eos> chrysler corp. had a N N drop in car sales <unk> its generally slow performance all year <eos> however sales of trucks including the company 's popular minivans rose N N <eos> honda motor co.

suffering from its success <eos> while the network currently can operate freely in <unk> so can others <eos> in addition competition for <unk> is getting tougher in many ways than when broadcasting here was strictly controlled <eos> instead of being denounced as an evil agent of <unk> radio free europe is more likely to draw the criticism that its programs are too <unk> even boring <eos> they have a lot to do these days to compete with <unk> radio says andrew <unk> a <unk> student at the technical university in <unk> <eos> the <unk> radio reporters seem better informed and more critical about about what 's going on here <eos> indeed hungary is in the midst of a media explosion <eos> boys on busy street corners <unk> newspapers of every political <unk> <eos> <unk> are packed with a

approve radio free europe 's new location but the ministry of telecommunications did something even more amazing they found us four phone lines in central <unk> says <unk> <unk> a radio free europe <unk> who helped <unk> the <unk> location <eos> that is a <unk> <eos> it 's a far cry from the previous treatment of the network which had to overcome <unk> of its <unk> and <unk> of local <unk> who

keeping hope alive through what one writer here calls the dark ages of the 20th century <eos> during the past four years many of us have sat up until late at night listening to our <unk> says the

those who want to hear even more radical views have to get up at five on sunday morning for sunday journal on <unk> radio <eos> the competitive spirit is clearly <unk> radio free europe which is

service has a daily <unk> news show called <unk> with international and domestic news plus a daily news review of opinions from around the world <eos> there 's also a host of new programs trying to

resistance of the body <unk> run their course and seem to disappear only to <unk> and <unk> public life <unk> <eos> the disease <unk> comes to mind of course not as an <unk> on the advocates of national service <eos> rather it is born of frustration with having to combat constantly changing <unk> of a <unk> idea that one thought had been eliminated in the early 1970s along with <unk> <eos> it is back with us again in the form of legislation to pay <unk> under a national and community service act a proposal with a serious shot at congressional passage this fall <eos> why does the <unk> virus keep coming back <eos> perhaps it is because <unk> <unk> <unk> both military experience and the social <unk> <eos> if only we could get america 's <unk> youth into at least a <unk> uniform we might be able to teach <unk> again and revive the spirit of giving <eos> a quarter of a century ago national service was <unk> as a way of <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the draft by of all things expanding the draft <eos> those of us who resisted the idea then suspect today that an obligation of government service for all young people is still the true long-term aim of many <unk> backers despite their protests that present plans contain no <unk> <eos> choice of the volunteer military in the 1970s seemed to <unk> national service as much as the draft <eos> but the virus was kept alive in <unk> departments until a couple of years ago when it again was let loose <eos> this time it attempted to <unk> two connected problems the rising cost of higher education and the rising expense to the federal government of educational grants and loans <eos> why not keep and even expand the loans and grants the advocates <unk> but require some form of service from each <unk> <eos> military service moreover could be a <unk> option <eos> thus undoubtedly it was hoped that the new strain of national service would prove <unk> <unk> <unk> conservatives <unk> <unk> and <unk> liberals <eos> the democratic leadership council a <unk> group <unk> the plan surely thought it might help the party to attract support especially among college students and their parents <eos> a provision allowing grants to be applied to <unk> purchases was added to appeal to those who had had enough of <unk> <eos> the <unk> plan <unk> <unk> <unk> trees <unk> <unk> <unk> children and <unk> <unk> for $ N a week tax free plus medical care <eos> with a tax-free $ N <unk> payment at the end of each year the <unk> would be making a wage comparable to $ N a year <eos> mind you most of the <unk> would be <unk> N to <unk> some not even high school graduates and many saving money by living at home <eos> they would be doing better financially under national service than many taxpayers working at the same kinds of jobs and perhaps supporting families <eos> as it happened political resistance developed among educational and minority interests that count on the present education grant system so the <unk> <unk> decided to abandon the supposedly crucial principle of give in order to get <eos> opposition to national service from the pentagon which wants to protect its own <unk> process also led to the <unk> option being dropped <eos> clearly a new rationale for national service had to be <unk> up <eos> what better place to turn than sen. edward kennedy 's labor committee that great <unk> of government <unk> where many a <unk> pot of <unk> is kept on the back <unk> until it can be brought forward and presented as <unk> <unk> <eos> before the <unk> is printed the house may add more <unk> also changing the initial price now posted at some $ N million <eos> it is widely known that too many <unk> <unk> the <unk> but that wisdom does not necessarily reflect the view of the <unk> especially if they are senators <eos> the omnibus bill coming out of congress may be <unk> <unk> but the <unk> chefs are happy and the restaurant is pushing the <unk> very hard <eos> the <unk> of <unk> is in the air <eos> is the voluntary sector so weak that it needs such unsolicited assistance <eos> on the contrary it is as robust as ever <eos> according to the <unk> poll american adults contribute an average of two hours a week of service while financial contributions to charity in the 1980s have risen N N adjusted for inflation <eos> even if government does see various <unk> needs national service is not the way to meet them <eos> if we want to support students we might adopt the idea used in other countries of offering more <unk> based on something called <unk> rather than on the government 's idea of service <eos> or we might provide a tax credit for working students <eos> what we do not need to do is start a war and then try to justify it by creating a <unk> bill <eos> to the extent we lack manpower to staff <unk> jobs in hospitals for example we should raise pay pursue <unk> technology or allow more legal <unk> rather than <unk> high school graduates as short-term workers and cause <unk> among permanent workers paid lesser amounts to do the same jobs <eos> will national service in the current highly <unk> and <unk> form <unk> enough appeal to get adopted <eos> not necessarily <eos> polls show wide <unk> support for some vague concept of service but the bill now under discussion lacks any <unk> public backing <eos> nonetheless senate democrats are organizing a roll of supporting associations <unk> and <unk> some of which may hope to receive the paid <unk> <eos> so far the president seems <unk> to substitute any of the omnibus for his own <unk> proposal to <unk> a points of light foundation with $ N million to inform citizens of all ages and <unk> them to genuine <unk> <eos> however even this <unk> plan could become <unk> if the white house gives in to congressional democratic pressure to add to the scope of the president 's initiative or to involve the independent foundation in <unk> federal funds for volunteer projects <eos> there 's no need for such concessions <eos> the omnibus can be defeated the virus controlled and real service protected <eos> national service the <unk> idea still wo n't go away then of course but the millions of <unk> youth performing works of civic content will be <unk> only in the <unk> of their <unk> <eos> mr. <unk> is a fellow at the <unk> hudson institute <eos> this article is adapted from remarks at a <unk>

N <eos> the debate over national service has begun again <eos> after a decade in which more than N <unk> established their own service or conservation corps and dozens of school systems made community service a <unk> to high-school <unk> the focus has shifted to washington <eos> at least N bills proposing one or another national program were introduced in congress this spring <eos> one <unk> by

might well win senate passage <eos> president bush has outlined his own youth entering service yes plan though its details remain to be specified <eos> what is one to think of all this <eos> doctrine and special interests govern some responses <eos> people eager to have youth pay their <unk> to society favor service proposals <unk> mandatory ones <eos> so do those who seek a <unk> concept of <unk> a concept imposing stern obligations as well as <unk> rights <eos> then there are <unk> opponents <eos> to <unk> mandatory service is an <unk> and voluntary systems are <unk> uses of tax money <eos> <unk> of the market question the value of the work national service would perform <eos> if the market wo n't pay for it they argue it ca n't be worth its cost <eos> elements of the left are also <unk> opposed they see service as a cover for the draft or fear the <unk> of youth or want to see rights <unk> not obligations <eos> but what about those of us whose views are not <unk> by formula or <unk> <eos> how should we think about national service <eos> let 's begin by recognizing a main source of confusion national service has no agreed meaning <eos> would service be voluntary or <unk> <eos> short or long <eos> <unk> or full-time <eos> paid or unpaid <eos> would participants live at home and work nearby or live in <unk> and work on public <unk> <eos> what kinds of work would they do <eos> what does national mean <eos> would the program be run by the federal government by local governments or by private voluntary organizations <eos> and who would serve <eos> only males as with the draft or both <unk> <eos> youth only or all ages <eos> middle-class people or poor people or a genuine <unk> <eos> many or few <eos> those are not <unk> questions and the label national service answers none of them <eos> then how should we think about national service <eos> as a starting point here are five <unk> N consider the <unk> not the name <eos> ignore national service in the <unk> consider specific proposals <eos> they will differ in crucial ways <eos> N service should be service <eos> as commonly understood service implies sacrifice <eos> it involves accepting risk or giving up income or deferring a career <eos> it follows that proposals like <unk> whose benefits to <unk> are worth some $ N a year do not qualify <eos> there is a rationale for such bills federal subsidies to college students amount to a <unk> bill without the <unk> <unk> those benefits should be earned not given <eos> but the earnings exceed by N N the average income of young high-school graduates with full-time jobs <eos> why call that service <eos> N encouragement is fine <unk> is not <eos> <unk> service is unconstitutional <eos> it is also <unk> and <unk> <eos> who will throw several hundred thousand <unk> in jail each year <eos> but through tax policy and in other ways the federal government encourages many kinds of behavior <eos> it should also encourage service <unk> by all classes and all ages <eos> its encouragement should strengthen and not undercut the strong tradition of <unk> in the u.s. should build on the service programs already in existence and should honor local convictions about which tasks most need doing <eos> N good programs are not cheap <eos> enthusiasts assume that national service would get important work done <unk> forest fires fought housing <unk> students <unk> <unk> centers <unk> <eos> there is important work to be done and existing service and conservation corps have shown that even <unk> who start with few skills can do much of it well but not <unk> <eos> good service programs require <unk> <unk> training and supervision all of high quality <eos> they involve <unk> to participants <eos> full-time residential programs also require housing and full-time supervision they are particularly expensive more per participant than a year at stanford or yale <eos> <unk> programs are cheaper but good ones still come to some $ N a year <eos> are they worth that <eos> <unk> suggest that good ones are especially so if the effects on participants are counted <eos> but the calculations are <unk> <eos> N <unk> youth are a special concern <eos> are such expenditures <unk> then <eos> yes if targeted <eos> people of all ages and all classes should be encouraged to serve but there are many ways for middle-class kids and their elders to serve at little public cost <eos> they can volunteer at any of thousands of <unk> institutions or participate in service programs required by high schools or encouraged by colleges or employers <eos> <unk> youth do n't have those opportunities <eos> they are not <unk> in high school or college <eos> they are unlikely to be employed <eos> and they have grown up in <unk> grim circumstances among family structures breaking down surrounded by <unk> <unk> and bleak prospects <eos> but many of them can be quite <unk> <unk> by productive and disciplined service <eos> some wo n't accept the discipline others drop out for other reasons <eos> but some whom nothing else is reaching are transformed <eos> learning skills producing something <unk> feeling useful they are no longer dependent others now depend on them <eos> even if it is cheaper to build <unk> or <unk> apartments or plant <unk> with paid professionals the effects on the young people providing those services alter the <unk> <eos> strictly speaking these youth are not performing service <eos> they are giving up no income deferring no careers <unk> no risk <eos> but they believe themselves to be serving and they begin to respect themselves and others to take control of their lives to think of the future <eos> that is a service to the nation <eos> it is what federal support should try hardest to achieve <eos> mr. <unk> a carter administration budget official heads his own washington-based strategic planning firm <eos> he is a co-author of national service what would it mean <eos> lexington books N <eos> government officials here and in other countries laid plans through the weekend to head off a monday market <unk> but went out of their way to keep their moves quiet <eos> federal reserve chairman alan greenspan was on the telephones making it clear to officials in the u.s. and abroad that the fed was prepared to <unk> massive amounts of money into the banking system as it did in october N if the action were needed to prevent a financial crisis <eos> and at the treasury secretary nicholas brady talked with friends and associates on wall street while assistant secretary david mullins carefully <unk> data on the friday market plunge <eos> but the officials feared that any public announcements would only increase market jitters <eos> in addition officials at the fed and in the bush administration decided that avoiding <unk> actions and statements over the weekend would give them more strength and flexibility should friday 's market drop turn into this morning 's rout <eos> the disadvantage at this point is that anything you do that looks like you are doing too much tends to reinforce a sense of crisis said one government official insisting on <unk> <eos> the fed 's efforts at <unk> were partly <unk> sunday morning when both the new york times and the washington post carried stories <unk> a senior fed official saying the central bank was prepared to pour cash into the banking system monday morning <eos> fed chairman greenspan was surprised by both stories according to knowledgeable sources and insisted he had n't authorized any public comment <eos> nevertheless fed officials acknowledged the stories were reasonably accurate <unk> of the central bank 's game plan <eos> it is prepared to assume the same role it played in october N providing money to the markets if necessary to keep the financial system afloat <eos> the fed provides money to the banking system by buying government securities from financial institutions <eos> the <unk> of federal officials was evident in the appearance sunday of budget director richard darman on abc 's this week <eos> secretary of the treasury brady and chairman greenspan and the chairman of the sec and others have been in close contact <eos> i 'm sure they 'll do what 's right what 's prudent what 's <unk> he said <eos> when it was suggested his comment was a <unk> mr. darman replied it is a <unk> <eos> but in this context that 's the smart thing to do <eos> at the treasury secretary brady issued a statement <unk> the stock market 's drop <eos> today 's stock market decline does n't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy he said <eos> the economy remains <unk> and the outlook is for continued moderate growth <eos> but administration officials conceded that friday 's drop carried the chance of further declines this week <eos> one possibility is that this is a surgical setback reasonably limited in its <unk> and not a major problem said one senior administration official who also asked that he not be named <eos> the other is that we see another major disaster like two years ago <eos> i think that 's less likely <eos> nevertheless fed chairman greenspan and vice chairman manuel johnson were in their offices sunday evening monitoring events as they <unk> in markets around the world <eos> the action was expected to begin with the opening of the new zealand foreign exchange markets at N p.m. est when stocks there plunged and to continue as the trading day began later in the evening in tokyo and through early this morning in europe <eos> both the treasury and the fed planned to keep market rooms operating throughout the night to monitor the developments <eos> in tokyo share prices dropped sharply by N N in early monday morning trading <eos> after the initial slide the market appeared to be turning around but by early afternoon was headed lower <eos> in the bush administration the lead is being taken by treasury secretary brady undersecretary robert <unk> and assistant secretary mullins <eos> the three men worked together on the so-called brady commission headed by mr. brady which was established after the N crash to examine the market 's collapse <eos> as a result they have extensive knowledge in financial markets and financial market crises <eos> mr. brady was at the white house friday afternoon when the stock market 's decline began <eos> he was quickly on

after leaving for camp david <eos> he had frequent telephone <unk> with mr. brady and michael <unk> chairman of the counsel of economic advisers <eos> government officials tried throughout the weekend to <unk> a <unk> appearance in order to avoid any sense of panic <eos> treasury undersecretary david mulford for instance was at a meeting of the business council in hot springs va. when the stock market fell and remained there through the following day <eos> and as of last night fed chairman greenspan had n't canceled his plans to address the american bankers association convention in washington at N a.m. this morning <eos> ironically mr. greenspan was scheduled to address the same convention in dallas on oct.

N two years ago <eos> panic selling also was <unk> during other big declines in the past <eos> the crash of N was followed by a substantial recovery before the great depression and awful bear market of the 1930s began <eos> the october <unk> of N and N were scary but did n't lead to severe or sustained <unk> <eos> indeed some pros see friday 's plunge plus any further damage that might occur early this week as a chance for bargain hunting <eos> there has been a lot of emotional selling that presents a nice buying opportunity if you 've got the cash says stephen b. <unk> chief investment officer of chicago-based kemper financial services inc <eos> but most advisers think the immediate course for individual investors should be to stand pat <eos> when you see a runaway train says steve <unk> partner in the san francisco investment advisory firm brouwer & <unk> you wait for the train to stop <eos> even for people who expect a bear market in coming months and a sizable number of money managers and market <unk> do the advice is wait for the market to bounce back and sell shares gradually during rallies <eos> the best thing individual investors can do is just sit tight says marshall b. front executive vice president and head of investment counseling at stein roe & <unk> inc. a chicago-based investment counseling firm that manages about $ N billion <eos> on the one hand mr. front says it would be <unk> to sell into a classic panic <eos> on the other hand it 's not necessarily a good time to jump in and buy <eos> this is all <unk> right now and when <unk> starts to run it can run further than anyone anticipates he said <eos> so it 's more prudent to wait and see how things stabilize <eos> roger <unk> professor of finance at yale university and head of the market information firm <unk> associates inc. says my real advice would be to just ride through it <eos> generally it is n't <unk> to be in and out of the stock market <eos> mr. <unk> thinks that this week is going to be a roller-coaster week <eos> but he also thinks it is a good week to consider buying <eos> john <unk> former president of the los angeles chapter of the national association of investors corp. an organization of investment clubs and individual investors says his fellow club members did n't sell in the crash of N and see no reason to sell now <eos> we 're dedicated long-term investors not traders he says <eos> we understand <unk> and euphoria <eos> and we hope to take advantage of <unk> and buy stocks when they plunge <eos> one camp of investment pros sees what happened friday as an opportunity <eos> over the next days and weeks they say investors should look for stocks to buy <eos> friday 's action was an old-fashioned panic says alfred goldman director of technical market analysis for a.g. edwards & sons in st. louis <eos> stocks were being thrown out of windows at any price <eos> his advice you ought to be there with a basket catching them <eos> james craig portfolio manager for the <unk> <unk> fund which has one of the industry 's better track records started his buying during friday 's plunge <eos> stocks such as <unk> foods corp. <unk> stores inc. american international group inc. and federal national mortgage association became such bargains that he could n't resist them he says <eos> and mr. craig expects to pick up more shares today <eos> it will be chaotic at first but i would not be buying if i thought we were headed for real trouble he says <eos> he argues that stocks are reasonably valued now and that interest rates are lower now than in the fall of N <eos> mr. front of stein roe suggests that any buying should concentrate in stocks that have lagged the market on the up side or stocks that have been beaten down a lot more than the market in this correction <eos> his firm favors selected computer drug and <unk> stocks <eos> other investment pros are more pessimistic <eos> they say investors should sell stocks but not necessarily right away <eos> many of them stress that the selling can be orderly gradual and done when stock prices are <unk> <eos> on thursday william <unk> a seattle money manager used futures contracts in his personal account to place a bet that the broad market averages would decline <eos> he thinks the underlying inflation rate is around N N to N N far higher than most people <unk> <eos> in the pension accounts he manages mr. <unk> has raised cash positions and invested in gold and natural gas stocks partly as an inflation hedge <eos> he thinks government officials are <unk> to let a recession start when government corporate and personal debt levels are so high <eos> so he thinks the government will <unk> on the side of <unk> inflation <eos> as a result mr. <unk> says i think the ball game 's over and investors are about to face a bear market <eos> david m. jones vice president at <unk> g. <unk> & co. recommends treasury securities of up to five years ' maturity <eos> he says the oct. N employment report showing slower economic growth and a severe weakening in the manufacturing sector is a warning sign to investors <eos> one strategy for investors who want to stay in but hedge their bets is to buy put options either on the individual stocks they own or on a broad market index <eos> a put option gives its holder the right but not the obligation to sell a stock or stock index for a specified price the strike price until the option expires <eos> whether this insurance is <unk> depends on the cost of an option <eos> the cost or premium tends to get fat in times of crisis <eos> thus buying puts after a big market slide can be an expensive way to hedge against risk <eos> the prices of puts generally did n't soar friday <eos> for example the premium as a percentage of the stock price for certain puts on eli lilly & co. moved up from N N at thursday 's close to only N N at friday 's close even though the shares dropped more than $ N <eos> but <unk> prices may <unk> when trading <unk> today <eos> it 's hard to <unk> about a reasonable price for puts <eos> but investors should keep in mind before paying too much that the average annual return for stock holdings long-term is N N to N N a year a return of N N is considered <unk> <eos> paying say N N for insurance against losses takes a deep <unk> out of the return <eos> james a. white and tom <unk> contributed to this article <eos> <unk> banker commercial group said it sold $ N million of common stock to its employees at $ N a share giving them a total stake of more than N N in the commercial real estate brokerage firm <eos> the firm which was acquired in april from sears roebuck & co. in a management-led buy-out had planned to sell up to $ N million of stock or a N N stake in the company to its N employees <eos> though the offering did n't sell out james j. <unk> chairman and chief executive officer said we 're pretty proud of the employees ' response <eos> he noted that unlike an employee stock ownership plan where a company usually <unk> money from third party lenders to buy stock that it sets aside to award employees over time here employees had to <unk> out their own cash for the stock <eos> they came up with their own money instead of borrowed money mr. <unk> said <eos> it 's totally different <eos> he said the offering was designed to create long-term incentives for employees <eos> we 're in a service business and in that context it 's vital to have your employees involved in the ownership so they have a stake in the success <eos> the brokerage firm wo n't pay a dividend on the stock <eos> employees have the right to trade stock among themselves and the company will establish an internal clearing house for these transactions <eos> they may also eventually sell the shares to third parties but the outside investors who own the remaining N N of <unk> banker have the right to first refusal <eos> those outside investors in <unk> banker include <unk> group a

trading in the merc 's stock-index futures will break for N minutes if the contract opens and stays five points from friday 's close a move equal to N points on the dow jones industrial average <eos> the aim of the <unk> would be to ease the opening of the new york stock exchange which would be <unk> by such a volatile move on the merc <eos> that <unk> <unk> is just one of a number of <unk> adopted after the N crash <eos> the big board also added computer capacity to handle huge <unk> in trading volume <eos> several of those post-crash changes kicked in during friday 's one-hour collapse and worked as expected even though they did n't prevent a stunning plunge <eos> but the major circuit breakers have yet to be <unk> <eos> a deeper market plunge today could give them their first test <eos> a further slide also would <unk> debate over a host of other more sweeping changes proposed but not implemented after the last crash <eos> most notably several of the regulatory steps recommended by the brady task force which <unk> the N crash would be revived especially because that group 's chairman is now the treasury secretary <eos> the most controversial of the brady recommendations involved establishing a single <unk> regulator to handle crucial <unk> questions such as setting consistent margin requirements for the stock and futures markets <eos> but for the moment attention focuses on the reforms that were put into place and market regulators and participants said the circuit breakers worked as intended <eos> big board and merc officials expressed satisfaction with the results of two limits imposed on of the merc 's standard & poor 's N contract as well as <unk> communications among exchanges <eos> those <unk> from N p.m. to N p.m. <unk> and from N p.m. until the close of trading a half-hour later forced traders to buy and sell contracts at prices at or higher than their frozen levels <eos> during the first halt after the s&p index had fallen N points the big board 's <unk> computer program automatically was triggered <eos> that system is designed to separate <unk> program trades from all other trades to help exchange officials resolve order imbalances in individual stocks <eos> one merc broker compared the action in the s&p pit during the two <unk> to a fire at a <unk> school <eos> you do n't want the fire but you know what to do said howard <unk> an independent floor broker and a merc governor <eos> there was no panic <eos> the system worked the way we devised it to work <eos> after <unk> for about N minutes the s&p index tumbled to its <unk> limit and the second freeze went into effect <eos> traders then spent the last half-hour watching to see if the dow would drop N points mr. <unk> added referring to the level at which the stock market itself would have closed for an hour <eos> one <unk> estimated that N N to N N of the s&p traders were just standing around watching <eos> but the <unk> circuit breaker never had to kick in and <unk> on the chicago board of trade 's major market index also were n't triggered <eos> the mmi and the s&p N are the two major indexes used by program traders to run their computerized trading strategies <eos> the programs are considered by many to be a major cause of the N crash <eos> the process of post-crash reforms began with calls to <unk> the markets and wound up a year later with a series of rather technical adjustments <eos> in october N just after the market drop washington was <unk> in talk of sweeping changes in the way the financial markets are structured and regulated <eos> over the next year that grand agenda was <unk> down to a series of steps to soften big stock drops by <unk> trading to give market players time to <unk> and reconsider positions <eos> in addition limits were placed on computer-driven trading and steps were taken to better link the stock and futures markets <eos> few changes were made in the way the markets are regulated <eos> at the outset the prime target was program trading which was much discussed but little understood on capitol hill <eos> there were also calls to strip the stock markets of derivative products such as stock-index futures and options which federal judge stanley <unk> for example <unk> to <unk> attached to the basic market <eos> and there was much criticism of the new york stock exchange 's system of having stock trades flow through specialists or market makers <eos> when the brady task force 's powerful analysis of the crash was released in january N it immediately <unk> the reformers ' agenda <eos> arguing that the separate financial <unk> acted as one and concluding that the crash had raised the possibility of a <unk> financial system breakdown the presidential task force called for establishing a <unk> to oversee the markets to make margins consistent across markets to <unk> clearing systems and to install circuit breakers <eos> only the last of those recommendations ever was implemented <eos> the reagan white house held the brady recommendations at arm 's length and named a second panel the working group on the financial markets to review its analysis and those of other crash studies <eos> in may N the working group made up of representatives from the federal reserve the treasury the securities and exchange commission and the commodity futures trading commission finally endorsed only circuit breakers <eos> after several more months of arguments among various stock exchanges and futures markets circuit breakers were set in place with the most notable <unk> trading after N and N point drops in the dow jones industrial average <eos> privately some free <unk> dismissed such <unk> as <unk> to <unk> <eos> after all this free-market argument went the dow only dropped more than N points once this century <eos> circuit breakers set to soften big drops <eos> if s&p futures fall N points at opening contract trading <unk> for N

retail prices of <unk> foods have n't risen since last december but acknowledged that huge government subsidies were a main factor in keeping prices down <eos> the state statistical bureau found that more than N billion <unk> $ N million was spent in the first half of the year for pork subsidies <eos> the newspaper quoted experts as saying the subsidies would cause the difference between prices

completely japan has turned the tables on u.s. business <eos> americans used to complain bitterly about being <unk> by <unk> products from japan <eos> now sony whose innovative <unk> products are among the most <unk> in consumer electronics is bitterly complaining about a little u.s. firm with a cheap <unk> produced in china <eos> the <unk> of this is that justin knocked off the sony line and

who founded justin in N <eos> mr. <unk> had sold <unk> inc. a taiwan electronics maker and retired only to find he was <unk> <eos> with justin he began selling toys and electronics made mostly in hong

papers sony says it has spent more than $ N million to promote the line with resulting sales of over a million units <eos> sony found a new market niche but mr. <unk> figured that its prices left plenty of room for a <unk> competitor <eos> his products are n't exact copies of sony 's but strongly resemble them in size shape and especially color <eos> sony uses mostly red and blue with <unk> of yellow and so does justin on the theory that kids prefer these colors <eos> to be successful a product can be any color <unk> as long as it is <unk> red says charles e. <unk> justin 's attorney <eos> by last winter justin was showing <unk> at toy <unk> in hong kong and new york and sony noticed <eos> indeed concerned that sony sales personnel were threatening legal action or other <unk> such as

department <eos> but justin has n't pursued those charges which were without merit according to mr. <unk> the sony attorney <eos> recalls mr. <unk> our purpose was to influence them to leave us alone <eos> we never intended taking on sony we do n't have the resources <eos> sony answered the empty threat with its real suit <eos> off and on since then the companies have <unk> in court <eos> and justin in a news release says once competitive sony now resorts to <unk> tactics in american <unk> to <unk> out and protect niche markets <eos> sony 's lawyer insists that the company 's tactics including the use of a private <unk> <unk> as a buyer are routine in such matters <eos> he also insists that sony no less than others has a legal right to protect its trade dress in this case mostly the colors that it claims make my first sony products distinctive <eos> justin claims it began using the same colors on electronic goods for children long before sony entered the children 's market <eos> whatever its merits sony 's aggressive defense is <unk> for justin <eos> it 's also costly <eos> mr. <unk> says he has paid more than $ N in legal fees so far <eos> of sony mr. <unk> says they

start of this decade have been declining for months as issuer after issuer sank beneath the weight of hefty interest payments <eos> the shaky market received its biggest jolt last month from campeau

flight to quality in the other said maria ramirez money market economist at drexel burnham lambert inc <eos> nevertheless the problems of the junk market could prompt the federal reserve to ease credit in the months ahead <eos> this marks a significant shift in the interest rate outlook says william sullivan director of money market research at dean witter reynolds inc. new york <eos> any sustained <unk> could be a lift for junk bonds as well as other securities <eos> robert dow a partner and portfolio manager at lord <unk> & co. which manages $ N billion of high-yield bonds says he does n't think there is any fundamental economic rationale for the junk bond rout <eos> it was <unk> <unk> <eos> he adds the junk market has <unk> some trouble and now some people think that if the equity market gets <unk> that means the economy will be terrible and that 's bad for junk <eos> i do n't believe that 's the case but i believe that people are running scared <eos> there is a flight to quality and the quality is not in equities and not in junk it 's in treasurys <eos> even as trading in high-yield issues <unk> up over the past month corporations sold more than $ N billion of new junk bonds <eos> for example a recent $ N million offering of <unk> gas services l.p. bonds sold by first boston was three times oversubscribed <eos> a $ N million offering of turner broadcasting system inc high-yield securities sold last week by drexel was increased $ N million because of strong demand <eos> first boston estimates that in november and december alone junk bond investors will

people can say the junk bond market disappeared when there were $ N billion of orders for $ N million of junk bonds sold last week by turner says raymond <unk> <unk> of merchant banking at merrill lynch & co <eos> when the rally comes insurance companies will be leading it because they have billions to invest and invest they will <eos> there is plenty of money available from people who want to buy <unk> deals it 's the stuff that 's financed on a <unk> that people are wary of <eos> but such highly leveraged transactions seemed to have <unk> this year casting a pall over much of the junk market <eos> michael <unk> director of fixed-income research at kemper financial services says the quality of junk issues has been getting poorer contributing to the slide in prices <eos> last year we probably bought one out of every three new deals he says <eos> this year at best it 's in one in every five or six <eos> and our credit standards have n't changed one <unk> <eos> however mr. <unk> said the slide in junk is creating one hell of a buying opportunity for selective buyers <eos> for the moment investors seem more <unk> with the bad junk than the good junk <eos> the market has been weak since the announcement of the campeau cash squeeze and the company 's subsequent bailout by olympia & york says mr. <unk> of merrill lynch <eos> that really affected the market in that people started to ask what else is in trouble <eos> well before campeau though there were signs that the junk market was <unk> through one of its worst years ever <eos> despite the relatively strong economy junk bond prices did nothing except go down <unk> by a seemingly endless trail of bad news <eos> in june two months before it would default on interest payments covering some of its $ N billion of speculative debt securities new york-based integrated resources inc. said it ran out of borrowed money <eos> in july southmark corp. the dallas-based real estate and financial services company with about $ N billion of junk bonds voluntarily filed for protection under u.s. bankruptcy law <eos> by the end of july the difference in yield between an index of junk bonds and seven-year treasury notes widened to more than N percentage points <eos> in august resorts international inc. which sold more than $ N million of junk bonds suspended interest payments <eos> in september just as the cash squeeze hit campeau <unk> financial corp. defaulted on $ N million of notes and appeared unlikely to pay interest on a total of $ N billion of debt securities <eos> meantime regulators are becoming increasingly worried as the rush to leverage shows no signs of <unk> <eos> moody 's says the frequency of corporate credit <unk> is the highest this year since N <eos> in addition there are six times as many troubled banks as there were in the recession of N according to the federal deposit insurance corp <eos> the era of the 1980s is about compound interest and the reaching for it says james grant editor of grant 's interest rate <unk> an early critic of the junk bond market <eos> what we 've begun to see is the damage to businesses of paying <unk> compound interest <eos> businesses were borrowing at interest rates higher than their own earnings <eos> what we 're seeing now is the <unk> <unk> of asset values to a future when <unk> debt will be hard to obtain rather than easy <eos> friday 's market activity <eos> prices of treasury bonds surged in the biggest rally of the year as investors fled a <unk> stock market <eos> the benchmark 30-year treasury bond was quoted N p.m. edt at N N compared with N N thursday up N N points <eos> the yield on the benchmark fell to N N the lowest since march N N according to technical data global markets group <eos> the flight to quality

injection of huge amounts of liquidity to <unk> the financial markets and keep the economy from slowing into a recession <eos> prices of municipals investment-grade <unk> and mortgage-backed bonds also rose but lagged behind their treasury counterparts <eos> mortgage securities rose in hectic trading with most of the activity concentrated in government national mortgage association N N coupon securities the most liquid mortgage issue <eos> the ginnie mae november N N issue ended at N N up N point on the day to yield about N N to a 12-year average life assumption <eos> investment-grade corporate bonds were up about N to N point <eos> but the yield spread between <unk> investment-grade issues and <unk> bonds widened <eos> and the yields on telephone and utility issues rose relative to other investment-grade bonds in anticipation of this week 's $ N billion bond offering by the tennessee valley authority <eos> despite rumors that the tva 's long-awaited offering would be postponed because of the debacle in the equity markets sources in the underwriting syndicate said they expect the issue will be priced as scheduled <eos> one of the sources said the smaller portions of $ N million each of five-year and 10-year bonds have already been substantially oversubscribed <eos> municipal bonds rose as much as N point <eos> roger <unk> contributed to this article <eos> friday 's 190-point plunge in stocks does not come <unk> the climate of anxiety that dominated financial markets just prior to their N october crash and <unk> have been put in place to keep markets more orderly <eos> still the lesson is about the same on friday the 13th the market was spooked by washington <eos> the consensus along the street seems to be that the plunge was triggered by the financing problems of the ual takeover and it 's certainly true the rout began immediately after the ual trading halt <eos> still the consensus seems almost as wide that one <unk> bid is no reason to write down the value of all u.s. business <eos> this <unk> leads us to another piece of news moving on the dow jones <unk> shortly before the downturn the success of senate democrats in <unk> the capital gains tax cut <eos> the real value of all shares after all is directly <unk> by the tax on any profits all the more so given the limits on deductions for losses that show gains are not ordinary income <eos> and market expectations clearly have been raised by the capital gains victory in the house last month <eos> an hour before friday 's plunge that provision was stripped from the tax bill leaving it with $ N billion in tax increases without a capital gains cut <eos> there is a great deal to be said to be sure for <unk> the garbage out of the reconciliation bill <eos> it would be a good thing if congress started to decide issues <unk> on their individual merits without <unk> <eos> for one thing no one doubts that the capital gains cut would pass on an <unk> vote <eos> since senate leaders have so far <unk> it up with procedural <unk> promises of a cleaner bill are suspect <eos> especially so since president bush has been weakened by the panama <unk> <eos> to the extent that the ual troubles contributed to the plunge they are another instance of washington 's <unk> fingers <eos> as the best opportunities for corporate restructurings are exhausted of course at some point the market will start to reject them <eos> but the airlines are <unk> a clear case given anti-takeover <unk> by secretary of transportation skinner who <unk> to believe safety will be <unk> if <unk> and british airways own interests in companies that fly airplanes <eos> worse congress has started to jump on the skinner <unk> <eos> james <unk> the minnesota democrat who chairs the public works and transportation committee 's aviation subcommittee has put an <unk> takeover bill on <unk> speed so that it would be passed in time to affect the american and united air lines bids <eos> it would give mr. skinner up to N days to review any bid for N N or more of the voting stock of any u.s. carrier with revenues of $ N billion or more <eos> so the ual deal has problems and the market loses N points <eos> <unk> mr. secretary and mr. congressman <eos> in the N crash remember the market was shaken by a danny <unk> proposal to tax takeovers out of <unk> <eos> even more important in our view was the treasury 's threat to <unk> the dollar <eos> the treasury is doing the same thing today <unk> the dollar is not under <unk> pressure <eos> also traders are in better shape today than in N to survive selling <unk> <eos> they are better capitalized <eos> they are in less danger of losing liquidity simply because of tape <unk> and clearing and settlement delays <eos> the fed promises any needed liquidity <eos> the big board 's <unk> with the chicago board of trade has improved it will be interesting to learn if circuit breakers prove to be a good idea <eos> in any event some traders see stocks as <unk> today unlike N <eos> there is nothing wrong with the market that ca n't be <unk> by a little <unk> and common sense in washington <eos> but on the bearish side that may be too much to expect <eos> first chicago corp. posted a third-quarter loss of $ N million after joining other big banks in further adding to its reserves for losses on foreign loans <eos> the parent company of first national bank of chicago with $ N billion in assets said it set aside $ N million to absorb losses on loans and investments in financially troubled countries <eos> the addition on top of two big N additions to <unk> reserves brings the reserve to a level equaling N N of <unk> and long-term loans outstanding to troubled nations <eos> first chicago since N has reduced its loans to such nations to $ N billion from $ N billion <eos> despite this loss first chicago said it does n't need to sell stock to raise capital <eos> during the quarter the company realized a pretax gain of $

credibility is at best <unk> <eos> he has ample motive to shift the blame and his testimony has also been found less than <unk> on numerous points <eos> nevertheless the new democracy and communist parties herald his <unk> as proof of <unk> <unk> <eos> among <unk> questions are whether mr. <unk> received $ N million of stolen bank of <unk> funds and an additional $ N in <unk> as contended whether the prime minister ordered state agencies to deposit some $ N million in mr. <unk> 's bank and then <unk> off the interest and what <unk> 's cut was from the $ N million mr. <unk> <unk> <eos> two former ministers were so heavily <unk> in the <unk> affair that <unk> members of parliament voted to refer them to the special court <eos> but <unk> parliamentary probe was the case of millions of <unk> mr. <unk> <unk> into new democracy <unk> <eos> in the end the investigation produced only <unk> evidence and indications that point to <unk> not <unk> proof <eos> on another issue <unk> were told how their national intelligence agency the <unk> regularly monitored the telephone conversations of prominent figures including key opposition politicians journalists and <unk> cabinet members <eos> despite convincing arguments it was never established that mr. <unk> personally ordered or directed the <unk> <eos> the central weakness of the scandals debates was pointed up especially well when discussions focused on arms deals and <unk> <eos> the coalition government tried to show that <unk> ministers had received hefty sums for <unk> the purchase of <unk> fighting falcon and mirage N combat aircraft produced by the <unk> general dynamics corp. and france 's <unk> <unk> dassault respectively <eos> naturally neither general dynamics nor dassault could be expected to <unk> its

<unk> regain power mr. <unk> should never be underestimated <eos> first came his predictable <unk> he charged the coalition of the left and progress had sold out its leftist <unk> by <unk> in a <unk> plot aimed at <unk> <unk> and <unk> the course of socialism in greece <eos> then to <unk> his credibility with the left he <unk> some smaller leftist parties to stand for election under the <unk> <unk> <eos> next he continued to court the communists many of whom feel <unk> by the <unk> coalition 's birth by bringing into <unk> a <unk> communist party candidate <eos> for balance and in hopes of gaining some <unk> <unk> votes he managed to attract a former new democracy party representative and known political enemy of mr. <unk> <eos> thus <unk> heads for the polls not only with diminished

donaldson said it is highly confident that it will be able to sell $ N million of junk bonds for vitro despite the current disarray in the junk bond market <eos> donaldson 's statement is n't merely

the purchase of real estate or the signing of a commercial lease <eos> to take full advantage of the financial opportunities in this commitment however the corporation or professional firm must do

real-estate markets <unk> to shifts in regional economies and then take advantage of these opportunities <eos> when a regional economy <unk> cold the local real-estate market gets <unk> <eos> in other words real-estate market indicators such as building permits and leasing activity plummet much further than a local economy in recession <eos> this was seen in the late 1960s in los angeles and the

local real-estate markets <unk> to regional economic cycles <eos> because real-estate purchases and leases are such major long-term commitments that most companies and individuals make these decisions only when confident of future economic stability and growth <eos> metropolitan detroit was written off economically during the early 1980s as the domestic auto industry suffered a serious sales depression and adjustment <eos> area employment dropped by N N from its N peak and retail sales were down N N <eos> however the real-estate market was hurt even more <eos> for example residential

soared a staggering N N between N and the peak year of N <eos> where <unk> corporations and professional firms are now asking are today 's opportunities <eos> look no further than metropolitan houston

metropolitan area whose economic health is not as easy to determine as houston 's or denver 's <eos> generally overcapacity in commercial real estate is dropping from its mid-1980s peak even in such

under these conditions even a <unk> out of economic growth catching cold in the healthy metropolitan areas will create significant opportunities for corporations and professional service firms looking

he also argued that the high court was wrong in N to rule that <unk> have a right to abortion that ca n't be absolutely vetoed by their parents <eos> the administration 's position was outlined in a

if the state has a reasonable <unk> for adopting it <eos> that is a much easier standard for a state to satisfy than the supreme court 's test since N which requires a state to have a compelling

N <eos> aluminum co. of america hit hard by the strength of the dollar overseas said net income for the third quarter dropped N N to $ N million or $ N a share <eos> the nation 's no. N aluminum maker earned $ N million or $ N a share a year earlier <eos> revenue rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion <eos> analysts who were expecting <unk> to post around $ N to $ N a share were surprised at the lackluster third-quarter results <eos> it 's disappointing said william <unk> an analyst with smith barney harris upham & co <eos> much of the earnings decline was led by <unk> rate adjustments which affected the bottom line by $ N million or N cents a share compared with $ N million or four cents a share the previous year <eos> lower prices for aluminum <unk> and certain <unk> products and a shift in the product mix also contributed to lower earnings the company said <eos> in addition costs were higher partly due to scheduled plant <unk> for modernization work the company said <eos> excluding the higher tax rate which rose two percentage points to N N and the negative exchange rate adjustment the company would have met analysts ' expectations said r. wayne <unk> an analyst with goldman sachs & co <eos> noting that the third quarter is usually the aluminum industry 's <unk> mr. <unk> added the third quarter is never a bang up period for them anyway <eos> nevertheless the company said shipments were up slightly to N metric tons from N <unk> the impact of the unexpected earning decline <eos> the results were announced after the stock market closed <eos> in new york stock exchange composite trading friday <unk> closed at $ N a share down $ N in a sharply lower market <eos> for N years federal rules have barred the three major television networks from sharing in one of the most lucrative and fastest-growing parts of the television business <eos> and for six years nbc abc and cbs have negotiated with hollywood studios in a <unk> attempt to change that <eos> but with foreign companies <unk> up u.s. movie studios the networks are pressing their fight harder than ever <eos> they hope the foreign deals will divide the hollywood opposition and <unk> congress to push for ending federal rules that prohibit the networks from <unk> a piece of <unk> sales and owning part of the shows they put on the air <eos> even network executives however admit privately that victory either in congress or in talks with the studios is highly doubtful any time soon <eos> and so the networks also are pushing for new ways to <unk> the <unk> provisions known formally as the financial interest and <unk> rules <eos> that became clear last week with the disclosure that national broadcasting co. backed by the deep pockets of parent general electric co. had tried to help fund qintex australia ltd. 's <unk> $ N billion bid for mgm\/ua communications co <eos> nbc 's interest may revive the deal which mgm\/ua killed last week when the australian concern had trouble raising cash <eos> even if that deal is n't revived nbc hopes to find another <eos> our doors are open an nbc spokesman says <eos> nbc may yet find a way to take a passive minority interest in a <unk> without violating the rules <eos> and any nbc effort could prompt cbs inc. and abc 's parent capital cities\/abc inc. to look for ways of <unk> the <unk> regulations <eos> but the networks ' push may only <unk> an increasingly bitter <unk> between them and hollywood studios <eos> both sides are to sit down next month for yet another meeting on how they might agree on reducing <unk> restraints <eos> few people <unk> to the talks expect the studios to <unk> <eos> the networks still are <unk> in their authority over what shows get on the air charges motion picture association president jack <unk> the most <unk> opponent of <unk> the rules <eos> studios are <unk> to get shows in prime-time <unk> and keep them there long enough to go into lucrative <unk> sales he contends <eos> and that 's why the rules for the most part must stay in place he says <eos> studio executives in on the talks including officials at paramount communications inc. <unk> entertainment inc. warner communications inc. and mca inc. declined to be interviewed <eos> but mr. <unk> who represents the studios asserts the whole production industry to a man is on the side of preserving the rules <eos> such <unk> leave network officials all the more doubtful that the studios will <unk> <eos> they do n't seem to have an incentive to negotiate says one network executive <eos> and there 's no indication that washington is prepared to address the rules <eos> that 's the problem is n't it <eos> indeed it is <eos> congress has said repeatedly it wants no part of the mess urging the studios and the networks which license rights to air shows made by the studios to work out their own compromise <eos> but recent developments have made the networks and nbc president robert wright in particular ever more <unk> that the networks must be <unk> to survive <eos> the latest <unk> sony corp. 's plan to acquire columbia pictures entertainment inc. for $ N billion and to buy independent producer guber peters entertainment co. for $ N million <eos> i wonder what walter <unk> will think of the <unk> broadcast system <unk> evening news with dan rather broadcast exclusively from tokyo wrote <unk> <unk> an nbc vice president in a commentary in last week 's issue of broadcasting magazine <eos> in his article mr. <unk> who was in europe last week and unavailable complained that the <unk> restraints in <unk> rules have contributed directly to the acquisition of the studios by non-u.s. enterprises <eos> he did n't mention that nbc in the meantime was hoping to assist australia 's qintex in buying <eos> an nbc spokesman <unk> that mr. <unk> 's <unk> was entirely consistent with nbc plans because the u.s. rules would limit nbc 's involvement in the qintex deal so severely as to be light years away from the type of <unk> deals available to sony and everyone else except the three networks <eos> the big three 's <unk> for deregulation began <unk> in the summer when the former time inc. went ahead with plans to acquire warner <eos> although time already had a long-term contract to buy movies from warner the merger will let time 's largely <unk> <unk> channel home box office own the warner movies aired on hbo a <unk> integration that is effectively blocked by <unk> regulations <eos> nbc 's mr. wright led the way in <unk> the networks ' inability to match a <unk> combination <eos> he spoke up again when the sony bid for columbia was announced <eos> since nbc 's interest in the qintex bid for mgm\/ua was disclosed mr. wright has n't been available for comment <eos> with a qintex deal nbc would move into <unk> territory possibly raising <unk> at the studios and in washington <eos> it 's never really been tested says william <unk> iii who as a top cbs executive spent years lobbying to have the rules lifted <eos> he now runs policy communications in washington consulting to media companies <eos> <unk> rules do n't <unk> block a network from buying a passive small stake in a company that profits from the <unk> <unk> networks ca n't enjoy <eos> hence nbc might be able to take say a N N stake in a company such as mgm\/ua <eos> if the transaction raised objections the studio 's <unk> operations could be spun off into a separate firm in which the network does n't have a direct stake <eos> but such <unk> would still block the networks from <unk> a big chunk of the <unk> of <unk> <eos> under current rules even when a network fares well with a <unk> series abc for example made a killing in broadcasting its popular <unk> <unk> it is n't allowed to share in the continuing proceeds when the reruns are sold to local stations <eos> instead abc will have to sell off the rights for a one-time fee <eos> the networks admit that the chances of getting the relief they want are slim for several years at the least <eos> six years ago they were <unk> close <eos> the <unk> federal communications commission had ruled in favor of killing most of the rules <eos> various evidence including a <unk> institution study of some N series that the networks had aired and had partly owned in the 1960s showed the networks did n't <unk> <unk> control over the studios as had been alleged <eos> but just eight days before the rules were to die former president ronald reagan a one-time actor intervened on behalf of hollywood <eos> the fcc effort collapsed <eos> the networks and studios have <unk> ever since <eos> network officials involved in the studio talks may hope the foreign influx builds more support in washington but that seems unlikely <eos> in congress the issue <unk> it 's about money not program quality and hollywood has lots of clout given its fund raising for senators and representatives overseeing the issue <eos> a spokesman for rep. edward j. markey <unk> who heads a subcommittee that oversees the fcc says mr. markey feels the world has been forever changed by the <unk> deal <eos> but he said mr. markey hopes this <unk> the networks and studios to work it out on their own <eos> and at the fcc meanwhile new chairman alfred c. <unk> has said he wants the two sides to <unk> out their own plan <eos> recognition equipment inc. said it settled a civil action filed against it by the federal government on behalf of the u.s. postal service <eos> the government sued the company in april seeking $ N and other unspecified damages related to an alleged <unk> scheme <eos> the suit named the company former

<eos> in the agreement recognition agreed to pay the government $ N in return for the release of all claims against the company mr. moore and mr. <unk> <eos> the five additional defendants were n't parties to the settlement <eos> a trial on criminal allegations against the company and the same two former executives began sept. N in federal court for the district of columbia <eos> they were indicted last october on charges of fraud theft and conspiracy related to an effort to win $ N million in postal service equipment contracts by the maker of data management equipment <eos> the company and its executives deny the charges <eos> in a related development recognition equipment said the postal service has barred the company from bidding on postal contracts for an additional N days <eos> the postal service originally suspended the company oct. N N and has been renewing the ban ever since <eos> the company said it will continue to pursue a lifting of the suspension <eos> intel corp. reported a N N drop in third-quarter net income partly because of a one-time charge for discontinued operations <eos> the big semiconductor and computer maker said it had net of $ N million or N cents down N N from $ N million or N cents a share <eos> the lower net included a charge of $ N million equal to N cents a share on an after-tax basis for the cost of abandoning a <unk> joint venture with siemens ag of west germany <eos> earning also fell from

appeared relieved that the company 's income from continuing operations was only slightly below the second quarter 's earnings of $ N million or N cents a share and that sales actually exceeded the $

N years in prison mr. sisulu the <unk> former <unk> of the liberation movement was dropped off at his house by a prison services ' van just as the sun was coming up <eos> at the same time six anc colleagues five of whom were arrested with him in N and sentenced to life <unk> were <unk> with their families at various places around the country <eos> and as the <unk> men returned to their homes the anc outlawed in south africa since N and still considered to be the chief public enemy by the white government <unk> returned to the streets of the country 's black <unk> <eos> a huge anc flag with black green and gold <unk> was <unk> over the <unk> gate at mr. sisulu 's modest house while on the street out front boys displayed the anc colors on their shirts <unk> and <unk> <eos> at the small <unk> home of <unk> <unk> a leading anc <unk> and a former <unk> in the group 's armed <unk> <unk> we <unk> <unk> stuck little anc flags in their hair and a man <unk> on an <unk> horn <unk> in anc <unk> <eos> i am happy to see the spirit of the people said mr. sisulu looking <unk> in a new gray suit <eos> as the crowd outside his home shouted anc anc the old man shot his <unk> into the air <eos> i 'm inspired by the mood of the people <eos> under the laws of the land the anc remains an illegal organization and its headquarters are still in <unk> <unk> <eos> but the <unk> release of the seven leaders who once formed the intellectual and <unk> core of the anc is a de <unk> <unk> of the movement and the <unk> of its internal <unk> <eos> the government can never put the anc back into the bottle again said <unk> <unk> a veteran <unk> activist on hand to welcome mr. sisulu <eos> things have gone too far for the government to stop them now <eos> there 's no turning back <eos> there was certainly no <unk> the tide of anc <unk> last night when hundreds of people <unk> into the <unk> cross <unk> church in <unk> for what became the first anc rally in the country in N years <eos> <unk> <unk> of anc and <unk> we <unk> shook the church as the seven aging men vowed that the anc would continue its fight against the government and the policies of racial <unk> on all fronts including the armed struggle <eos> and they called on the government to release nelson <unk> the anc 's leading figure who was jailed with them and remains in prison <eos> without him said mr. sisulu the <unk> of the others is only a <unk> <eos> president <unk> de <unk> released the anc men along with one of the founding members of the pan <unk> congress a rival liberation group as part of his efforts to create a climate of trust and peace in which his government can begin negotiations with black leaders over a new constitution aimed at giving blacks a voice in national government <eos> but pretoria may instead be creating a climate for more turmoil and uncertainty in this <unk> divided country <eos> as other <unk> governments particularly poland and the soviet union have recently discovered initial steps to open up society can create a momentum for radical change that becomes difficult if not impossible to control <eos> as the days go by the south african government will be ever more hard pressed to justify the continued <unk> of mr. <unk> as well as the continued banning of the anc and enforcement of the state of emergency <eos> if it does n't yield on these matters and eventually begin talking directly to the anc the expectations and promise raised by yesterday 's releases will turn to <unk> and unrest <eos> if it does the large number of <unk> whites who oppose any concessions to the black majority will step up their <unk> and threats to take matters into their own hands <eos> the newly released anc leaders also will be under enormous pressure <eos> the government is watching closely to see if their presence in the <unk> leads to increased <unk> protests and violence if it does pretoria will use this as a reason to keep mr. <unk> behind bars <eos> pretoria has n't forgotten why they were all sentenced to life <unk> in the first place for sabotage and conspiracy to <unk> the government <eos> in addition the government is figuring that the releases could create a split between the internal and external wings of the anc and between the newly freed leaders and those activists who have emerged as leaders inside the country during their <unk> <eos> in order to head off any divisions mr. <unk> in a meeting with his colleagues before they were released instructed them to report to the anc headquarters in <unk> as soon as possible <eos> the men also will be faced with <unk> the generation gap between themselves and the country 's many <unk> black <unk> the so-called young <unk> who are anxious to see the old <unk> in action <eos> says peter <unk> president of the south african youth congress we will be expecting them to act like leaders of the anc <eos> they never considered themselves to be anything else <eos> at last night 's rally they called on their <unk> to be firm yet disciplined in their opposition to apartheid <eos> we <unk> discipline because we know that the government is very very sensitive said andrew <unk> another early <unk> leader who is now N <eos> we want to see nelson <unk> and all our <unk> out of prison and if we are n't disciplined we may not see them here with us
